I caught sight of her at the play and in answer to her beckoning I went over during the interval and sat
down beside her. It was long since I had last seen her and if someone had not mentioned her name I do not think
I would have recognized her. She addressed me brightly.\n
\"Well, it\'s many years since we first met. How time flies! We are not getting any younger. Do you
remember the first time I saw you? You asked me to luncheon.\"\n
Did I remember?\n
It was twenty years ago and I was living in Paris. I had a tiny apartment in the Latin Quarter and I was
earning barely enough money to keep body and soul together. \n
She had read a book of mine and had written to
me about it. I answered, thanking her, and presently I received from her another letter saying that she was
passing through Paris and would like to have a chat with me; but her time was limited and the only free moment
she had was on the following Thursday. She asked me if I would give her a little luncheon at Foyot\'s.
Foyot\'s is a restaurant at which the French senators eat and it was so far beyond my means that I had \nnever even thought
of going there. But I was flattered and I was too young to say no to a woman. \n
I had eighty francs to live on till the end of the month and a modest luncheon should not cost more than fifteen.\n
If I cut out coffee for the next
two weeks I could manage well enough.\n\n

I answered that I would meet her at Foyot\'s on Thursday at half past twelve.
She was not so young as I expected and in appearance imposing rather than attractive. She was in fact a
woman of forty, and she gave me the impression of having more teeth, white and large and even, than were
necessary for any practical purpose.\n
She was talkative, but since she seemed inclined to talk about me I was
prepared to be an attentive listener. \n
I was startled when the menu was brought, for the prices were a great deal
higher than I had expected. But she reassured me.\n
\“I never eat anything for luncheon,\" she said.\n
\"Oh, don\'t say that!\" I answered generously.\n
\"I never eat more than one thing. I think people eat too much nowadays. A little fish, perhaps. I wonder if
they have any salmon.\"\n
Well, it was early in the year for salmon and it was not on the menu, but I asked the waiter if there was any.
Yes, they had a beautiful salmon, it was the first they had had. I ordered it for my guest.
The waiter asked her if
she would have something while it was being cooked.\n
\"No,\" she answered, \"I never eat more than one thing. Unless you had a little caviar. \nI never mind caviar.\"
My heart sank a little. \nI knew I could not afford caviar, but I could not tell her that. I told the waiter by all
means to bring caviar. For myself I chose the cheapest dish on the menu and that was a mutton chop.
\"I think you\'re unwise to eat meat,\" she said. \"I don\'t know how you can expect to work after eating heavy
things like chops. I never overload my stomach.\"
Then came the question of drink.
\"I never drink anything for luncheon,\" she said.\n
\"Neither do I,\" I answered promptly.
\"Except white wine,\" she went on as though I had not spoken. "These French white wines are so light. They
are wonderful for the digestion.\"
\"What would you like?\" I asked her.

\"My doctor won\'t let me drink anything but champagne.\" I think I turned a little pale. I ordered half a
bottle. I mentioned casually that my doctor had absolutely forbidden me to drink champagne.\n
\"What are you going to drink, then?\"
\"Water.\"\n
She ate the caviar and she ate the salmon. She talked gaily of art and literature and music. But I wondered
what the bill would come to. When my mutton chop arrived she said:
\"I see that you're in the habit of eating a heavy luncheon. I\'m sure it\'s a mistake. Why don\'t you follow my
example and just eat one thing? I\'m sure you\'d feel much better then.\"\n
\"I am only going to eat one thing,\" I said, as the waiter came again with the menu. She waved him aside
with a light gesture.
\"No, no, I never eat anything for luncheon. Just a bite, I never want more than that. I can\'t eat anything
more unless they had some of those giant asparagus. I should be sorry to leave Paris without having some of
them.\"
My heart sank. I had seen them in the shops and I knew that they were horribly expensive. My mouth had
often watered at the sight of them. \"Madame wants to know if you have any of those giant asparagus,\" I asked
the waiter.\n\n

I hoped he would say no. A happy smile spread over his broad face, and he assured me that they had some
so large, so splendid, so tender, that it was a marvel.
\"I\'m not in the least hungry,\" my guest sighed, \"but if you insist I don't mind having some asparagus.\”
I ordered them.
\"Aren't you going to have any?\"
\"No, I never eat asparagus.\"\n
\"I know there are people who don't like them.\"
We waited for the asparagus to be cooked. Panic seized me. It was not a question now how much money I
should have left for the rest of the month, but whether I had enough to pay the bill.\n It would be terrible to find
myself ten francs short and be obliged to borrow from my guest. I could not bring myself to do that. I knew
exactly how much money I had and if the bill came to more I made up my mind that I would put my hand in my
pocket and with a dramatic cry start up and say my money had been stolen. \nIf she had not money enough to pay
the bill then the only thing to do would be to leave my watch and say I would come back and pay later.\n
The asparagus appeared. They were enormous and appetizing.\n The smell of the melted butter tickled my
nostrils. I watched the woman send them down her throat and in my polite way I talked on the condition of the
drama in the Balkans. At last she finished.
\"Coffee?\" I said.\n
\"Yes, just an ice-cream and coffee,\" she answered.\n
It was all the same to me now, so I ordered coffee for myself and an ice-cream and coffee for her.
\"You know, there's one thing I thoroughly believe in,\" she said, as she ate the ice-cream. \"One should
always get up from a meal feeling one could eat a little more.\"
\"Are you still hungry?\" I asked faintly.
\"Oh, no, I\'m not hungry; you see, I don't eat luncheon. I have a cup of coffee in the morning and then
dinner, but I never eat more than one thing for luncheon. I was speaking for you.\"
\"Oh, I see!\"\n\n

Then a terrible thing happened. While we were waiting for the coffee, the head waiter, with a smile on his
false face, came up to us bearing a large basket full of huge peaches. Peaches were not in season then. Lord
knew what they cost. I knew too — a little later, for my guest, going on with her conversation, absent-mindedly
took one.\n \"You see, you\'ve filled your stomach with a lot of meat and you can\'t eat any more. But I\'ve just had a
snack and I shall enjoy a peach.\"\n
The bill came and when I paid it I found that I had only enough for a quite inadequate tip. \nHer eyes rested
for a moment on the three francs I left for the waiter and I knew that she thought me mean.\n But when I walked
out of the restaurant I had the whole month before me and not a penny in my pocket.\n
\"Follow my example," she said as we shook hands, \"and never eat more than one thing for luncheon.\"
\"I\'ll do better than that,\" I answered. \"I\'ll eat nothing for dinner tonight.\"
\"Humorist!\" she cried gaily, jumping into a cab.\n \"You\'re quite a humorist!\"
But I have had my revenge at last. Today she weighs twenty-one stone.\'\n\n

Knowing that Mrs. Mallard was afflicted with a heart trouble, great care was taken to break to
her as gently as possible the news of her husband’s death.\n\n

It was her sister Josephine who told her, in broken sentences; veiled hints that revealed in half concealing.
Her husband’s friend Richards was there, too, near her.\n
It was he who had been in the newspaper office when intelligence of the railroad disaster was received,
with Brently Mallard\’s name leading the list of \“killed.\”
He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by a second telegram,
and had hastened to forestall any less careful, less tender friend in bearing the sad message.\n\n

She did not hear the story as many women have heard the same, with a paralyzed inability
to accept its significance. She wept at once, with sudden, wild abandonment, in her sister\’s arms.
When the storm of grief had spent itself she went away to her room alone. She would have no one follow her.

\n\n There stood, facing the open window, a comfortable, roomy armchair. Into this she sank,
pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach into her soul.

She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver
with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the street
below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant song which some one was
singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves.\n\n

There were patches of blue sky showing here and there through the clouds that had met
and piled one above the other in the west facing her window.\n\n

She sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion of the chair, quite motionless,
except when a sob came up into her throat and shook her, as a child who has cried
itself to sleep continues to sob in its dreams.\n\n

She was young, with a fair, calm face, whose lines bespoke repression and even a certain strength.
But now there was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was fixed away off yonder
on one of those patches of blue sky. It was not a glance of reflection,
but rather indicated a suspension of intelligent thought.\n\n

There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully.
What was it? She did not know; it was too subtle and elusive to name.
But she felt it, creeping out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds,
the scents, the color that filled the air.\n\n

Now her bosom rose and fell tumultuously. She was beginning to recognize this thing
that was approaching to possess her, and she was striving to beat it back with her
will—as powerless as her two white slender hands would have been.\n\n

When she abandoned herself a little whispered word escaped her slightly parted lips.
She said it over and over under her breath: \“free, free, free!\” The vacant stare
and the look of terror that had followed it went from her eyes. They stayed keen and bright.
Her pulses beat fast, and the coursing blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body.\n\n

She did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her.\n
A clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial.\n\n

She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death;
the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead.
But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely.
And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.\n\n

There would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself.
There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men
and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature.
A kind intention or a cruel intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked
upon it in that brief moment of illumination.\n\n

And yet she had loved him—sometimes. Often she had not.
What did it matter! What could love, the unsolved mystery,
count for in the face of this possession of self-assertion which
she suddenly recognized as the strongest impulse of her being!
\“Free! Body and soul free!\” she kept whispering.\n\n

Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with
her lips to the keyhold, imploring for admission. \“Louise, open the door! I beg;
open the door—you will make yourself ill. What are you doing, Louise? For heaven\’s
sake open the door.\”\n\n

\“Go away.
I am not making myself ill.\” No;
she was drinking in a very elixir of life through that open window.\n\n

Her fancy was running riot along those days ahead of her.
Spring days, and summer days, and all sorts of days that would be her own.
She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long.\n
It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be long.\n\n

She arose at length and opened the door to her sister\’s importunities.
There was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory.
She clasped her sister\’s waist, and together they descended the stairs.
Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom.\n\n

Some one was opening the front door with a latchkey.
It was Brently Mallard who entered, a little travel-stained,
composedly carrying his grip-sack and umbrella. He had been far
from the scene of the accident, and did not even know there had been one.
He stood amazed at Josephine\’s piercing cry; at Richards\’ quick motion to
screen him from the view of his wife.\n
But Richards was too late.\n
When the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease—of joy that kills.\n\n

It once occurred to a certain king, that if he always knew the right time to begin everything;
if he knew who were the right people to listen to, and whom to avoid; and, above all,
if he always knew what was the most important thing to do, he would never fail in anything he might undertake.

\n\nAnd this thought having occurred to him, he had it proclaimed throughout his kingdom that he
would give a great reward to any one who would teach him what was the right time for every action,
\n\nand who were the most necessary people, and how he might know what was the most important thing to do.

And learned men came to the King, but they all answered his questions differently.\n\n

In reply to the first question, some said that to know the right time for every action,
one must draw up in advance, a table of days, months and years, and must live strictly according to it.
Only thus, said they, could everything be done at its proper time.
Others declared that it was impossible to decide beforehand the right time for every action;
but that, not letting oneself be absorbed in idle pastimes, one should always attend to all
that was going on, and then do what was most needful. Others, again, said that however attentive
the King might be to what was going on, it was impossible for one man to decide correctly the
right time for every action, but that he should have a Council of wise men, who would help
him to fix the proper time for everything.
\n\n

But then again others said there were some things which could not wait to be laid before a Council,
but about which one had at once to decide whether to undertake them or not. But in order to decide
that, one must know beforehand what was going to happen. It is only magicians who know that; and,
therefore, in order to know the right time for every action, one must consult magicians.\n\n

Equally various were the answers to the second question. Some said, the people the King most
needed were his councillors; others, the priests; others, the doctors; while some said the
warriors were the most necessary.\n\n

To the third question, as to what was the most important occupation: some replied that the
most important thing in the world was science. Others said it was skill in warfare; and others,
again, that it was religious worship.\n\n

All the answers being different, the King agreed with none of them, and gave the reward to none.
But still wishing to find the right answers to his questions, he decided to consult a hermit,
widely renowned for his wisdom.\n\n

The hermit lived in a wood which he never quitted, and he received none but common folk.
So the King put on simple clothes, and before reaching the hermit\'s cell
dismounted from his horse, and, leaving his body-guard behind, went on alone.\n\n

When the King approached, the hermit was digging the ground in front of his hut.
Seeing the King, he greeted him and went on digging. The hermit was frail and weak,
and each time he stuck his spade into the ground and turned a little earth, he breathed heavily.\n\n

The King went up to him and said: \'I have come to you, wise hermit,
to ask you to answer three questions: How can I learn to do the right thing at the right time?
Who are the people I most need, and to whom should I, therefore,
pay more attention than to the rest? And, what affairs are the most important,
and need my first attention?\'\n\n

The hermit listened to the King, but answered nothing.\n
He just spat on his hand and recommenced digging.\n\n

\'You are tired,\' said the King, \'let me take the spade and work awhile for you.\'\n

\'Thanks!\' said the hermit, and, giving the spade to the King, he sat down on the ground\n\n

When he had dug two beds, the King stopped and repeated his questions.
The hermit again gave no answer, but rose, stretched out his hand for the spade, and said\n

\'Now rest awhile—and let me work a bit.\'\n\n

But the King did not give him the spade, and continued to dig. One hour passed, and another.
The sun began to sink behind the trees, and the King at last stuck the spade into the ground, and said:\n\n

\'I came to you, wise man, for an answer to my questions.
If you can give me none, tell me so, and I will return home.\'

\'Here comes some one running,\' said the hermit, \'let us see who it is.\'\n\n

The King turned round, and saw a bearded man come running out of the wood.
The man held his hands pressed against his stomach, and blood was flowing from under them.
When he reached the King, he fell fainting on the ground moaning feebly.
The King and the hermit unfastened the man\'s clothing. There was a large wound in his stomach.
The King washed it as best he could, and bandaged it with his handkerchief and with a towel the hermit had.
But the blood would not stop flowing, and the King again and again removed the
bandage soaked with warm blood, and washed and rebandaged the wound.
When at last the blood ceased flowing, the man revived and asked for something to drink.
The King brought fresh water and gave it to him. Meanwhile the sun had set, and it had become cool.
So the King, with the hermit\'s help, carried the wounded man into the hut and laid him on the bed.
Lying on the bed the man closed his eyes and was quiet; but the King was so tired
with his walk and with the work he had done, that he crouched down on the threshold,
and also fell asleep—so soundly that he slept all through the short summer night.
When he awoke in the morning, it was long before he could remember where he was,
or who was the strange bearded man lying on the bed and gazing intently at him with shining eyes.\n\n

\'Forgive me!\' said the bearded man in a weak voice, when he saw that the King was awake and was looking at him.

\'I do not know you, and have nothing to forgive you for,\' said the King.\n\n

\'You do not know me, but I know you. I am that enemy of yours who swore to revenge himself on you,
because you executed his brother and seized his property. I knew you had gone alone to see the hermit,
and I resolved to kill you on your way back. But the day passed and you did not return.
So I came out from my ambush to find you, and I came upon your bodyguard, and they recognized me, and wounded me.
I escaped from them, but should have bled to death had you not dressed my wound.
I wished to kill you, and you have saved my life. Now, if I live,
and if you wish it, I will serve you as your most faithful slave, and will bid my sons do the same. Forgive me!\'

\n\nThe King was very glad to have made peace with his enemy so easily,
and to have gained him for a friend, and he not only forgave him,
but said he would send his servants and his own physician to attend him,
and promised to restore his property.\n\n

Having taken leave of the wounded man, the King went out into the porch and
looked around for the hermit. Before going away he wished once more to
beg an answer to the questions he had put. The hermit was outside, on his knees,
sowing seeds in the beds that had been dug the day before.\n\n

The King approached him, and said:\n

\'For the last time, I pray you to answer my questions, wise man.\'n

\'You have already been answered!\' said the hermit still crouching on his thin legs,
and looking up at the King, who stood before him.\n

\'How answered? What do you mean?\' asked the King.\n\n

\'Do you not see,\' replied the hermit.
\'If you had not pitied my weakness yesterday,
and had not dug those beds for me, but had gone your way,
that man would have attacked you, and you would have repented of not having stayed with me.
So the most important time was when you were digging the beds; and I was the most important man;
and to do me good was your most important business. Afterwards when that man ran to us,
the most important time was when you were attending to him, for if you had not bound up his
wounds he would have died without having made peace with you. So he was the most important man,
and what you did for him was your most important business. Remember then: there is only one time
that is important—Now! It is the most important time because it is the only time when we have any power.
The most necessary man is he with whom you are, for no man knows whether he will ever have dealings with any one else:
and the most important affair is, to do him good, because for that purpose alone was man sent into this life!\'1903.\n\n

They were new patients to me, all I had was the name, Olson. Please come down as soon as you can,
my daughter is very sick.\n
When I arrived I was met by the mother, a big startled looking woman, very clean and apologetic who
merely said, Is this the doctor? and let me in. In the back, she added. You must excuse us, doctor,
we have her in the kitchen where it is warm. It is very damp here sometimes.
The child was fully dressed and sitting on her father\'s lap near the kitchen table. He tried to get up,
but I motioned for him not to bother, took off my overcoat and started to look things over. I could see
that they were all very nervous, eyeing me up and down distrustfully. As often, in such cases,
they weren\'t telling me more than they had to, it was up to me to tell them;\n\n


that\'s why they were spending three dollars on me.
The child was fairly eating me up with her cold, steady eyes, and no expression to her face whatever.
She did not move and seemed, inwardly, quiet; an unusually attractive little thing,
and as strong as a heifer in appearance. But her face was flushed, she was breathing rapidly,
and I realized that she had a high fever. She had magnificent blonde hair, in profusion.
One of those picture children often reproduced in advertising leaflets and the
photogravure sections of the Sunday papers.\n
She\'s had a fever for three days, began the father and we don\'t know what it comes from.
My wife has given her things, you know, like people do, but it don\'t do no good.
And there\'s been a lot of sickness around. So we tho\'t you\'d better look her over and tell us what is the matter.
As doctors often do I took a trial shot at it as a point of departure. Has she had a sore throat?
Both parents answered me together, No . . . No, she says her throat don\'t hurt her.
Does your throat hurt you? added the mother to the child. But the little girl\'s expression didn\'t
change nor did she move her eyes from my face.\n\n
Have you looked?


I tried to, said the mother, but I couldn\'t see.
As it happens we had been having a number of cases of diphtheria in the school to
which this child went during that month and we were all, quite apparently, thinking of that,
though no one had as yet spoken of the thing.
Well, I said, suppose we take a look at the throat first. I smiled in my best professional manner
and asking for the child\'s first name I said, come on, Mathilda, open your mouth and let\'s take a look at your throat.
Nothing doing.\n
Aw, come on, I coaxed, just open your mouth wide and let me take a look.
Look, I said opening both hands wide, I haven\'t anything in my hands. Just open up and let me see.
Such a nice man, put in the mother. Look how kind he is to you. Come on, do what he tells you to.
He won\'t hurt you.\n
At that I ground my teeth in disgust. If only they wouldn\'t use the word \"hurt\" I might be able to get somewhere.
But I did not allow myself to be hurried or disturbed but speaking quietly and slowly I approached the child again.
As I moved my chair a little nearer suddenly with one catlike movement both her hands
clawed instinctively for my eyes and she almost reached them too.
In fact she knocked my glasses flying and they fell, though unbroken, several feet away from me on the kitchen floor.
Both the mother and father almost turned themselves inside out in embarrassment and apology.
You bad girl, said the mother, taking her and shaking her by one arm. Look what you\'ve done.
The nice man . . .\n\n

For heaven\'s sake, I broke in. Don\'t call me a nice man to her.
I\'m here to look at her throat on the chance that she might have diphtheria and possibly die of it.
But that\'s nothing to her. Look here, I said to the child, we\'re going to look at your throat.
You\'re old enough to understand what I\'m saying. Will you open it now by yourself or shall we have to open it for you?
Not a move. Even her expression hadn\'t changed. Her breaths however were coming faster and faster.
Then the battle began. I had to do it.\n\n

I had to have a throat culture for her own protection. But first I told the parents that it was entirely up to them.
I explained the danger but said that I would not insist on a throat examination so long as they would take the responsibility.
If you don\'t do what the doctor says you\'ll have to go to the hospital, the mother admonished her severely.
Oh yeah? I had to smile to myself. \nAfter all, I had already fallen in love with the savage brat,
the parents were contemptible to me. \nIn the ensuing struggle they grew more and more abject, crushed,
exhausted while she surely rose to magnificent heights of insane fury of effort bred of her terror of me.
The father tried his best, and he was a big man but the fact that she was his daughter, his shame at her
behavior and his dread of hurting her made him release her just at the
critical times when I had almost achieved success, till I wanted to kill him.\n
But his dread also that she might have diphtheria made him tell me to go on,
go on though he himself was almost fainting, while the mother moved back and forth
behind us raising and lowering her hands in an agony of apprehension.
Put her in front of you on your lap, I ordered, and hold both her wrists.
But as soon as he did the child let out a scream. Don\'t, you\'re hurting me.
Let go of my hands. Let them go I tell you. \nThen she shrieked terrifyingly, hysterically.
Stop it! Stop it! You\'re killing me!\n
Do you think she can stand it, doctor! said the mother.
You get out, said the husband to his wife. Do you want her to die of diphtheria?
Come on now, hold her, I said.\n
Then I grasped the child\'s head with my left hand and tried to get the wooden tongue depressor between her teeth.
She fought, with clenched teeth, desperately! But now I also had grown furious—at a child.
I tried to hold myself down but I couldn\'t. \nI know how to expose a throat for inspection.
And I did my best. When finally I got the wooden spatula behind the last teeth and just the
point of it into the mouth cavity, she opened up for an instant but before I could see anything
she came down again and gripping the wooden blade between her molars she reduced it to splinters before I could get it out again.
Aren\'t you ashamed, the mother yelled at her.\n Aren\'t you ashamed to act like that in front of the doctor?
Get me a smooth-handled spoon of some sort, I told the mother. We\'re going through with this.
The child\'s mouth was already bleeding. Her tongue was cut and she was screaming in wild hysterical shrieks.
Perhaps I should have desisted and come back in an hour or more. No doubt it would have been better.
But I have seen at least two children lying dead in bed of neglect in such cases, and feeling that
I must get a diagnosis now or never I went at it again.\n But the worst of it was that I too had got beyond reason.
I could have torn the child apart in my own fury and enjoyed it. It was a pleasure to attack her.
My face was burning with it.\n
The damned little brat must be protected against her own idiocy, one says to one\'s self at such times.
Others must be protected against her. It is a social necessity. And all these things are true.
But a blind fury, a feeling of adult shame, bred of a longing for muscular release are the operatives.
One goes on to the end.\n
In a final unreasoning assault I overpowered the child\'s neck and jaws. I forced the heavy silver spoon
back of her teeth and down her throat till she gagged. And there it was—both tonsils covered with membrane.
She had fought valiantly to keep me from knowing her secret. She had been hiding that sore throat for three
days at least and lying to her parents in order to escape just such an outcome as this.
Now truly she was furious. She had been on the defensive before but now she attacked. Tried to get off her
father\'s lap and fly at me while tears of defeat blinded her eyes.\n\n

Early that day the weather turned and the snow was melting into dirty water.
Streaks of it ran down from the little shoulder-high window that faced the backyard.
Cars slushed by on the street outside, where it was getting dark.
But it was getting dark on the inside too.\n\n

He was in the bedroom pushing clothes into a suitcase when she came to the door.\n

I\’m glad you\’re leaving! I\’m glad you\’re leaving! she said. Do you hear?\n

He kept on putting his things into the suitcase.\n

Son of a bitch! I\’m so glad you\’re leaving! She began to cry. You can\’t even look me in the face, can you?\n

Then she noticed the baby\’s picture on the bed and picked it up.\n

He looked at her and she wiped her eyes and stared at him before turning and going back to the living room.\n

Bring that back, he said.\n

Just get your things and get out, she said.\n

He did not answer. He fastened the suitcase, put on his coat, looked around the bedroom before turning off the light.
Then he went out to the living room.\n

She stood in the doorway of the little kitchen, holding the baby.\n

I want the baby, he said.\n

Are you crazy?\n

No, but I want the baby. I\’ll get someone to come for his things.\n

You\’re not touching this baby, she said. The baby had begun to cry and she uncovered the blanket from around his head.

\n Oh, oh, she said, looking at the baby.\n

He moved toward her.\n

For God\’s sake! she said. She took a step back into the kitchen.\n

I want the baby.\n

Get out of here!\n

She turned and tried to hold the baby over in a corner behind the stove.\n

But he came up. He reached across the stove and tightened his hands on the baby.\n

Let go of him, he said.\n

Get away, get away! she cried.\n

The baby was red-faced and screaming. In the scuffle they knocked down a flowerpot that hung behind the stove.
He crowded her into the wall then, trying to break her grip. He held onto the baby and pushed with all his weight.

Let go of him, he said.\n

Don\’t, she said. You\’re hurting the baby, she said.\n

I\’m not hurting the baby, he said.\n

The kitchen window gave no light.\n
In the near dark he worked on her fisted fingers with one hand and with the other hand he
gripped the screaming baby up under an arm near the shoulder.\n

She felt her fingers being forced open. She felt the baby going from her.\n

No! she screamed just as her hands came loose.\n

She would have it, this baby. She grabbed for the baby\’s other arm. She caught the baby around the wrist and leaned back.

\nBut he would not let go. He felt the baby slipping out of his hands and he pulled back very hard.\n

In this manner, the issue was decided.

He came in without a word. I was stropping my best razor. And when I recognized him, I started to
shake. But he did not notice. To cover my nervousness, I went on honing the razor. I tried the edge with the
tip of my thumb and took another look at it against the light.\n
Meanwhile he was taking off his cartridge-studded belt with the pistol holster suspended from it. He put
it on a hook in the wardrobe and hung his cap above it. Then he turned full around toward me and, loosening
his tie, remarked, \“It\’s hot as the devil, I want a shave.\” With that he took his seat.\n I estimated he had a
four days\’ growth of beard, the four days he had been gone on the last foray after our men. His face looked burnt,
tanned by the sun.\n
I started to work carefully on the shaving soap. I scraped some slices from the cake, dropped them into
the mug, then added a little lukewarm water, and stirred with the brush. The lather soon began to rise.\“The
fellows in the troop must have just about as much beard as I.\” I went on stirring up lather. \“But we did very
well, you know. We caught the leaders. Some of them we brought back dead; others are still alive. But they\’ll
all be dead soon.\”\n
\“How many did you take?\” I asked.
\“Fourteen. We had to go pretty far in to find them. But now they\’re paying for it. And not one will
escape; not a single one.\”\n
He leaned back in the chair when he saw the brush in my hand, full of lather. I had not yet put the sheet
on him. I was certainly flustered. Taking a sheet from the drawer, I tied it around my customer\’s neck.
He went on talking. He evidently took it for granted that I was on the side of the existing regime.
\“The people must have gotten a scare with what happened the other day,\” he said.\n
\“Yes,\” I replied, as I finished tying the knot against his nape, which smelt of sweat.\n
\“Good show, wasn\’t it?\”\n
\“Very good,\” I answered, turning my attention now to the brush. The man closed his eyes wearily and
awaited the cool caress of the lather. I had never had him so close before. The day he ordered the people to file
through the schoolyard to look upon the four rebels hanging there, my path had crossed his briefly. But the
sight of those mutilated bodies kept me from paying attention to the face of the man who had been directing it
all and whom I now had in my hands.\n
It was not a disagreeable face, certainly. And the beard, which aged him a bit, was not unbecoming. His
name was Torres. Captain Torres.\n
I started to lay on the first coat of lather. He kept his eyes closed.\n
\“I would love to catch a nap,\” he said, \“but there’s a lot to be done this evening.\”
I lifted the brush and asked, with pretended indifference: \“A firing party?\”
\“Something of the sort,\” he replied, \“but slower.\”\n
\“All of them?\”
\“No, just a few\.”\n
I went on lathering his face.\n My hands began to tremble again. The man could not be aware of this,
which was lucky for me. But I wished he had not come in. Probably many of our men had seen him enter the
shop. And with the enemy in my house I felt a certain responsibility.\n
I would have to shave his beard just like any other, carefully, neatly, just as though he were a good
customer, taking heed that not a single pore should emit a drop of blood. Seeing to it that the blade did not slip
in the small whorls. Taking care that the skin was left clean, soft, shining, so that when I passed the back of my
hand over it not a single hair should be felt. \nYes. I was secretly a revolutionary, but at the same time I was a
conscientious barber, proud of the way I did my job. And that four-day beard presented a challenge.\n
I took up the razor, opened the handle wide, releasing the blade, and started to work, downward from one
sideburn. The blade responded to perfection.\n The hair was tough and hard; not very long, but thick. \nLittle by
little the skin began to show through. \nThe razor gave its usual sound as it gathered up layers of soap mixed with
bits of hair. I paused to wipe it clean, and taking up the strop once more went about improving its edge, for I am
a painstaking barber.\n
The man, who had kept his eyes closed, now opened them, put a hand out from under the sheet, felt of
the part of his face that was emerging from the lather, and said to me, \“Come at six o\’clock this evening to the
school.\”
\“Will it be like the other day?\” I asked, stiff with horror.\n
\“It may be even better,\” he replied.\n
\“What are you planning to do?\”
\“I\’m not sure yet. But we\’ll have a good time.\”\n
Once more he leaned back and shut his eyes. I came closer, the razor on high.
\“Are you going to punish all of them?\” I timidly ventured.\n
\“Yes, all of them.\”
The lather was drying on his face. I must hurry. Through the mirror, I took a look at the street. \nIt
appeared about as usual; there was the grocery shop with two or three customers. Then I glanced at the clock,
two-thirty.\n
The razor kept descending. Now from the other sideburn downward. It was a blue beard, a thick one. He
should let it grow like some poets, or some priests. It would suit him well. Many people would not recognize
him. And that would be a good thing for him, I thought, as I went gently over all the throat line. At this point
you really had to handle your blade skillfully, because the hair, while scantier, tended to fall into small whorls. It
was a curly beard. The pores might open, minutely, in this area and let out a tiny drop of blood. A good barber
like myself stakes his reputation on not permitting that to happen to any of his customers.\n
And this was indeed a special customer. How many of ours had he sent to their death? How many had
he mutilated? It was best not to think about it. \nTorres did not know I was his enemy. \nNeither he nor the others
knew it. It was a secret shared by very few, just because that made it possible for me to inform the
revolutionaries about Torres\’s activities in the town and what he planned to do every time he went on one of his
raids to hunt down rebels. So it was going to be very difficult to explain how it was that I had him in my hands
and then let him go in peace, alive, clean-shaven.\n
His beard had now almost entirely disappeared. He looked younger, several years younger than when
he had come in. I suppose that always happens to men who enter and leave barbershops. Under the strokes of
my razor Torres was rejuvenated; yes, because I am a good barber, the best in this town, and I say this in all
modesty.\n
A little more lather here under the chin, on the Adam\’s apple, right near the great vein. How hot it is!
Torres must be sweating just as I am. But he is not afraid. He is a tranquil man, who is not even giving thought
to what he will do to his prisoners this evening. I, on the other hand, polishing his skin with this razor but
avoiding the drawing of blood, careful with every stroke—I cannot keep my thoughts in order.
Confound the hour he entered my shop! I am a revolutionary but not a murderer. And it would be so
easy to kill him. He deserves it. Or does he? No! No one deserves the sacrifice others make in becoming
assassins. What is to be gained by it? Nothing. Others and still others keep coming, and the first kill the second,
and then these kill the next, and so on until everything becomes a sea of blood. I could cut his throat, so, swish,
swish! He would not even have time to moan, and with his eyes shut he would not even see the shine of the
razor or the gleam in my eye.\n
But I\’m shaking like a regular murderer. From his throat a stream of blood would flow on the sheet,
over the chair, down on my hands, onto the floor. I would have to close the door.\n But the blood would go
flowing along the floor, warm, indelible, not to be staunched, until it reached the street like a small scarlet river.
I\’m sure that with a good strong blow, a deep cut, he would feel no pain. He would not suffer at all.\n And
what would I do then with the body? Where would I hide it? I would have to flee, leave all this behind, take
shelter far away, very far away. But they would follow until they caught up with me. \“The murderer of Captain
Torres. He slit his throat while he was shaving him. What a cowardly thing to do!\”
And others would say, \“The avenger of our people. A name to remember\”—my name here. \“He was
the town barber. No one knew he was fighting for our cause.”\n
And so, which will it be? Murderer or hero? My fate hangs on the edge of this razor blade.
I can turn my wrist slightly, put a bit more pressure on the blade, let it sink in.\n The skin will yield like
silk, like rubber, like the strop.\n There is nothing more tender than a man\’s skin, and the blood is always there,
ready to burst forth. A razor like this cannot fail. It is the best one I have.\n
But I don\’t want to be a murderer. No, sir. You came in to be shaved. And I do my work honorably. I
don’t want to stain my hands with blood. Just with lather, and nothing else. \nYou are an executioner; I am only a
barber. Each one to his job. That\’s it. \nEach one to his job.
The chin was now clean, polished, soft. \nThe man got up and looked at himself in the glass. He ran his
hand over the skin and felt its freshness, its newness.\n
\“Thanks,\” he said. He walked to the wardrobe for his belt, his pistol, and his cap. \nI must have been very
pale, and I felt my shirt soaked with sweat. Torres finished adjusting his belt buckle, straightened his gun in its
holster, and smoothing his hair mechanically, put on his cap.\n From his trousers pocket he took some coins to
pay for the shave. And he started toward the door. On the threshold he stopped for a moment, and turning
toward me, he said, \“They told me you would kill me. I came to find out if it was true.\n But it\’s not easy to kill. I
know what I’m talking about.\”\n\n

She came to the place for the second time. The policeman stared down at her from his horse.

The time was afternoon. The yellow-coloured wall was stretched right along the road. Inside the wall
was a large rectangular three- storey building; its small identical windows looked more like dark apertures.
The woman stood a few paces away from the horse. The policeman looked behind him at the windows, then at the woman.
He placed both hands on the pommel of the saddle and closed his-eyes. After a while the horse moved.
It was standing halfway down the street. Then, a moment later, it made a half-turn and once again
stood itself at the top of the street.\n

The woman came two steps forward. The horse bent one of its forelegs, then gently lowered it.

\“Sergeant, please, just let me say two words to him.\”\n

His eyes remained closed, his hands motionless on the pommel. Above the wall stretched a
fencing of barbed wire at the end of which was a wooden tower. Inside there stood an armed soldier.\n

The woman took another step forward.\n

\“ You see, he’s been transferred …\”\n

The sun had passed beyond the central point in the sky. Despite this the weather was still hot.
A narrow patch of shade lay at the bottom of the wall.\n

The woman transferred the child to her shoulder.\n

When she again looked at the policeman\’s face, she noticed two thin lines of sweat on his forehead.\n

Quietly she moved away from in front of the horse and walked beside the wall.\n
About halfway along it she sat down on a heap of stones opposite the building.\n\n

The prisoners\’ washing, hung by the arms and legs, could be seen.\n

She took the child between her hands and lifted him above her head.\n

She noticed his arms suddenly being withdrawn inside and his hands gripping the iron bars of the window.
Then his face disappeared from view. For a while she searched for him among the faces that looked down.
She lowered her arms a little and heard shouts of laughter from the window.
She spotted his arm once again stretching outwards, then his face appeared clearly in the middle.\n\n

\“Up, Aziza. Up. Face him towards the sun so I can see him.\” She lowered her arms for a moment, then raised him up again,
turning his face towards the sun. The child closed his eyes and burst out crying.\n\n

\“He’s crying.\”\n

He turned round, laughing.\n

\“The boy\’s crying! The little so-and-so! Aziza, woman, keep him crying!\”\n

He cupped his hand round his mouth and shouted, \“Let him cry!\”\n

Again he laughed. A few shouts went up around him. She heard their words and shouting.
Then she saw his large nose poking out through the bars,\n

\“Woman! Don\’t be silly, that’s enough! Cover tile boy- he’ll get sunstroke!\”\n

She hugged the child to her chest and saw the soldier withdrawing inside the tower,\n

\“Did you prune the two date palms?\”\n

She shook her head.\n

\“Why not? Why don\’t you talk? I\’m being transferred. Pass by Abu Ismail and tell him I send him my best wishes.
He\’ll do it as a favour and prune the trees, then you can bring along a few dates. Did you bring the cigarettes?\”

\nShe made a sign with her hand.

\“Talk. What are you saying?\”\n

\“You\’ve got \‘em,\”\n

\“Louder, woman.\”\n

\“You\’ve got \‘em, I sent them to you.\”\n

\“When?\”\n

\“Just Now.\”\n

Her face was against the sun. She shifted her head-veil slightly from her head.\n

\“They took a couple of packets. Never mind, Aziza. Never mind.\”\n

He laughed. His voice had become calm. The other faces disappeared from above him,
only a single face remaining alongside his.\n

\“Did you build the wall?\”\n
\n

\“Not yet.\”\n

\“Why not?\”\n

\“When Uncle Ahmed lights the furnace, I\’ll get some bricks from him.\”\n

\“All right. Be careful on the tram. Look after the boy.\”\n

She remained standing.\n

\“Anything you want?\”\n

\“No.\”\n

She gazed at his face, his large nose, his bare arms. She smiled. The face next to him smiled back.\n

Suddenly be shouted. \“Did you get the letter? I\’m being transferred.\”\n

\“Where to?\”\n

\“I don’t know.\”\n

\“When?\”\n

\“You see, they\’re pulling down the prison.\”

\“Where will you go?\”\n

\“God knows-anywhere. No one knows.\”\n

\“When?\”

\“In two or three days. Don\’t come here again. I\’ll let you know when I\’m transferred. Has the boy gone to sleep?\”

\“No, he\’s awake.\”

He stared back for a while in silence.

\“Aziza !\”\n

Again there was silence. The face alongside his smiled, then slowly slid back inside and disappeared.
Her husband remained silent, his arms around the bars.\n

Suddenly he glanced behind him and quickly drew in his arms. He signalled to her to move away,
then disappeared from the window.\n

She stepped back, though she remained standing looking up at the window.\n\n

The important piece of news that the new headmaster had arrived spread through the school.
She heard of it in the women teachers\' common room as she was casting a final glance at the day\'s lessons.
There was no getting away from joining the other teachers in congratulating him, and from shaking him by the hand too.
A shudder passed through her body, but it was unavoidable.
\"They speak highly of his abilities,\" said a colleague of hers. \"And they talk too of his strictness.\"
It had always been a possibility that might occur, and now it had.  Her pretty face paled,
and a staring look came to her wide black eyes.\n\n

When the time came, the teachers went in single file, decorously attired, to his open room.
He stood behind his desk as he received the men and women.  He was of medium height,
with a tendency to portliness, and had a spherical face, hooked nose, and bulging eyes;
the first thing that could be seen of him was a thick, puffed-up mustache, arched like a foam-laden wave.
She advanced with her eyes fixed on his chest. Avoiding his gaze, she stretched out her hand.
What was she to say? Just what the others had said?  However, she kept silent, uttered not a word,
What, she wondered, did his eyes express? His rough hand shook hers, and he said in a gruff voice, \"Thanks.\"
She turned elegantly and moved off.\n\n

She forgot her worries through her daily tasks, though she did not look in good shape.
Several of the girls remarked, \"Miss is in a bad mood.\"
When she returned to her home at the beginning of the Pyramids Road,
she changed her clothes and sat down to eat with her mother.  \"Everything all right?\" inquired her mother, looking her in the face.

\n\n\"Badran, Badran Badawi,\" she said briefly.  \"Do you remember him? He\'s been appointed our headmaster.\"

\n\"Really!\"\n

Then after a moment of silence, she said, \"It\'s of no importance at all - it\'s an old and long-forgotten story.\"

\nAfter eating, she took herself off to her study to rest for a while before correcting some exercise books.
She had forgotten him completely. No, not completely.\n
How could he be forgotten completely? When he had first come to give her a private lesson in mathematics,
she was fourteen years of age. In fact, not quite fourteen.  He had been twenty-five years older, the same age as her father.
She had said to her mother, \"His appearance is a mess,
but he explains things well,\" And her mother had said, \"We are not concerned with what he looks like; what\'s
important is how he explains things.\"\n\n


He was an amusing person, and she got on well with him. and benefited from his knowledge.
How, then, had it happened? In her innocence she had not noticed any change in his behavior to put her on her guard.
Then one day he had been left on his own with her, her father having gone to her aunt\'s clinic.
She had not the slightest doubts about a man she regarded as a second father.
How, then, had it happened? Without love or desire on her part the thing had happened.
She had asked in terror about what had occurred, and he had told her, \"Don\'t be frightened or sad.
Keep it to yourself and I\'ll come and propose to you the day you come of age.\"\n\n

And he had kept his promise and had come to ask for her hand.
By then she had attained a degree of maturity that gave her an understanding of the dimensions of her tragic position.
She had found that she had no love or respect for him and that he was as far as
he could be from her dreams and from the ideas she had formed of what constituted an ideal an moral person.
But what was to be done? Her father had passed away two years ago, and her mother
had been taken aback by the forwardness of the man.  However,
she had said to her, \"I know your attachment to your personal independence, so I leave the decision to you.\"

\n\nShe had been conscious of the critical position she was in.
She had either to accept or to close the door forever.
It was the sort of situation that could force her into something she detested. She was the rich beautiful girl,
a byword in Abbaiyya for her nobility of character,
and now here she was struggling helplessly in a well-sprung trap, while he looked down at her with rapacious eyes.
Just as she had hated his strength, so too she hated her own weakness.
To have abused her innocence was one thing, but for him to have the upper
hand now that she was fully in possession of her faculties was something else.
He had said, \"So here I am, making good my promise because I love you.\"
He had also said, \"I know of your love of teaching, and you will complete your studies at the College of Science.\"

\n\nShe had felt such anger as she had never felt before.
She had rejected coercion in the same way as she rejected ugliness.
It had meant little to her to sacrifice marriage.  She had welcomed being on her own,
for solitude accompanied by self-respect was not loneliness. She had also guessed he was after her money.
She had told her mother quite straightforwardly, \"No,\" to which her mother had replied,
\"I am astonished you did not make this decision from the first moment.\"

\n\nThe man had blocked her way outside and said, \"How can you refuse? Don\'t you realize the outcome?\"
And she had replied with an asperity he had not expected, \"For me any outcome is preferable to being married to you.\"
After finishing her studies, she had wanted something to do to fill her spare time, so she had worked as a teacher.
Chances to marry had come time, but she had turned her back on them all.
\"Does no one please you?\" her mother asked her.
\"I know what I am doing,\" she had said gently.
\"But time is going by.\"
\"Let it go as it pleases, I am content.\"

\n\nDay by day she becomes older. She avoids love, fears it.
With all her strength she hopes that life will pass calmly, peacefully, rather than happily.
She goes on persuading herself that happiness is not confined to love and motherhood.
Never has she regretted her firm decision.  Who knows what the morrow holds?
But she was certainly unhappy that he could again make his appearance in her life,
that she would be dealing with him day after day, and that he would be making of the past a living and painful present.

\n\nThen, the first time he was alone with her in his room, he asked her, \"How are you?\"
She answered coldly, \"I\'m fine.\"
He hesitated slightly before inquiring, \" Have you not…I mean, did you get married\"
In the tone of someone intent on cutting short a conversation, she said \"I told you, I am fine.\"\n\n

To enter out into that silence that was the
city at eight o\'clock of a misty evening in November,
to put your feet upon that buckling concrete walk, to
step over grassy seams and make your way, hands in
pockets, through the silences, that was what Mr.
Leonard Mead most dearly loved to do. He would
stand upon the corner of an intersection and peer
down long moonlit avenues of sidewalk in four
directions, deciding which way to go, but it really
made no difference; he was alone in this world of
A.D. 2053, or as good as alone, and with a final
decision made, a path selected, he would stride off,
sending patterns of frosty air before him like the
smoke of a cigar.\n\n
Sometimes he would walk for hours and
miles and return only at midnight to his house. And
on his way he would see the cottages and homes with
their dark windows, and it was not unequal to
walking through a graveyard where only the faintest
glimmers of firefly light appeared in flickers behind
the windows. Sudden gray phantoms seemed to
manifest upon inner room walls where a curtain was
still undrawn against the night, or there were
whisperings and murmurs where a window in a tomb like building was still open.
Mr. Leonard Mead would pause, cock his
head, listen, look, and march on, his feet making no
noise on the lumpy walk. For long ago he had wisely
changed to sneakers when strolling at night, because
the dogs in intermittent squads would parallel his
journey with barkings if he wore hard heels, and
lights might click on and faces appear and an entire
street be startled by the passing of a lone figure,
himself, in the early November evening.\n\n
On this particular evening he began his
journey in a westerly direction, toward the hidden
sea. There was a good crystal frost in the air; it cut the
nose and made the lungs blaze like a Christmas tree
inside; you could feel the cold light going on and off,
all the branches filled with invisible snow. He
listened to the faint push of his soft shoes through
autumn leaves with satisfaction, and whistled a cold
quiet whistle between his teeth, occasionally picking
up a leaf as he passed, examining its skeletal pattern
in the infrequent lamplights as he went on, smelling
its rusty smell.\n\n
\"Hello, in there,\" he whispered to every
house on every side as he moved. \"What\'s up tonight
on Channel 4, Channel 7, Channel 9? Where are the
cowboys rushing, and do I see the United States
Cavalry over the next hill to the rescue?\"
The street was silent and long and empty,
with only his shadow moving like the shadow of a
hawk in midcountry. If he closed his eyes and stood
very still, frozen, he could imagine himself upon the
center of a plain, a wintry, windless Arizona desert
with no house in a thousand miles, and only dry river
beds, the streets, for company.\n\n
\"What is it now?\" he asked the houses,
noticing his wrist watch. \"Eight-thirty P.M.? Time for
a dozen assorted murders? A quiz? A revue? A
comedian falling off the stage?\"
Was that a murmur of laughter from within a
moon-white house? He hesitated, but went on when
nothing more happened. He stumbled over a
particularly uneven section of sidewalk. The cement
was vanishing under flowers and grass. In ten years
of walking by night or day, for thousands of miles, he
had never met another person walking, not once in all
that time.\n\n
He came to a cloverleaf intersection which
stood silent where two main highways crossed the
town. During the day it was a thunderous surge of
cars, the gas stations open, a great insect rustling and
a ceaseless jockeying for position as the scarab beetles, a faint incense puttering from their exhausts,
skimmed homeward to the far directions. But now
these highways, too, were like streams in a dry
season, all stone and bed and moon radiance.
He turned back on a side street, circling
around toward his home. He was within a block of his
destination when the lone car turned a corner quite
suddenly and flashed a fierce white cone of light
upon him. He stood entranced, not unlike a night
moth, stunned by the illumination, and then drawn
toward it.\n\n
A metallic voice called to him:
\"Stand still. Stay where you are! Don\'t
move!\"
He halted.\n
\"Put up your hands!\"
\"But-\" he said.\n
\"Your hands up! Or we\'ll Shoot!\"
The police, of course, but what a rare,
incredible thing; in a city of three million, there was
only one police car left, wasn\'t that correct? Ever
since a year ago, 2052, the election year, the force
had been cut down from three cars to one. Crime was
ebbing; there was no need now for the police, save for
this one lone car wandering and wandering the empty
streets.\n\n
\"Your name?\" said the police car in a
metallic whisper. He couldn\'t see the men in it for the
bright light in his eyes.
\"Leonard Mead,\" he said.
\"Speak up!\"
\"Leonard Mead!\"
\"Business or profession?\"
\"I guess you\'d call me a writer.\"
\"No profession,\" said the police car, as if
talking to itself. The light held him fixed, like a
museum specimen, needle thrust through chest.
\"You might say that, \" said Mr. Mead. He
hadn\'t written in years. Magazines and books didn\'t
sell any more. Everything went on in the tomblike
houses at night now, he thought, continuing his fancy.
The tombs, ill-lit by television light, where the people
sat like the dead, the gray or multicolored lights
touching their faces, but never really touching them.
\"No profession,\" said the phonograph voice,
hissing. \"What are you doing out?\"
\"Walking,\" said Leonard Mead.
\"Walking!\"
\"Just walking,\" he said simply, but his face
felt cold.\n
\"Walking, just walking, walking?\"
\"Yes, sir.\"
\"Walking where? For what?\"
\"Walking for air. Walking to see.\"
\"Your address!\"
\"Eleven South Saint James Street.\"
\"And there is air in your house, you have an
air conditioner, Mr. Mead?\"
\"Yes.\"\n\n
\"And you have a viewing screen in your
house to see with?\"
\"No.\"\n
\"No?\" There was a crackling quiet that in
itself was an accusation.
\"Are you married, Mr. Mead?\"
\"No.\"\n
\"Not married,\" said the police voice behind
the fiery beam, The moon was high and clear among
the stars and the houses were gray and silent.
\"Nobody wanted me,\" said Leonard Mead
with a smile.\n
\"Don\'t speak unless you\'re spoken to!\"
Leonard Mead waited in the cold night.
\"Just walking, Mr. Mead?\"
\"Yes.\"\n
\"But you haven\'t explained for what
purpose.\"\n
\"I explained; for air, and to see, and just to
walk.\"\n\n

\"Have you done this often?\"
\"Every night for years.\"\n
The police car sat in the center of the street
with its radio throat faintly humming.
\"Well, Mr. Mead,\" it said.
\"Is that all?\" he asked politely.
\"Yes,\" said the voice. \"Here.\" There was a
sigh, a pop. The back door of the police car sprang
wide. \"Get in.\"
\"Wait a minute, I haven\'t done anything!\"
\"Get in.\"\n
\"I protest!\"
\"Mr. Mead.\"
He walked like a man suddenly drunk. As he
passed the front window of the car he looked in. As
he had expected, there was no one in the front seat, no
one in the car at all.
\"Get in.\"\n\n

He put his hand to the door and peered into
the back seat, which was a little cell, a little black jail
with bars. It smelled of riveted steel. It smelled of
harsh antiseptic; it smelled too clean and hard and
metallic. There was nothing soft there.
\"Now if you had a wife to give you an alibi,\"
said the iron voice. \"But-\"
\"Where are you taking me?\"
The car hesitated, or rather gave a faint
whirring click, as if information, somewhere, was
dropping card by punch-slotted card under electric
eyes. \"To the Psychiatric Center for Research on
Regressive Tendencies.\"
He got in. The door shut with a soft thud.
The police car rolled through the night avenues,
flashing its dim lights ahead.
They passed one house on one street a
moment later, one house in an entire city of houses
that were dark, but this one particular house had all of
its electric lights brightly lit, every window a loud
yellow illumination, square and warm in the cool
darkness.\n
\"That\'s my house,\" said Leonard Mead.
No one answered him.
The car moved down the empty river-bed
streets and off away, leaving the empty streets with
the empty side-walks, and no sound and no motion all
the rest of the chill November night.\n\n

        <item>

Marta was nineteen. She looked out over the roof of the skyscraper, and seeing the city below shining in the dusk,
she was overcome with dizziness.
The skyscraper was silver, supreme and fortunate in that most beautiful and pure evening, as here and there the
wind stirred a few fine filaments of cloud against an absolutely incredible blue background. It was in fact the hour when
the city is seized by inspiration and whoever is not blind is swept away by it. From that airy height the girl saw the streets
and the masses of buildings writhing in the long spasm of sunset, and at the point where the white of the houses ended, the
blue of the sea began. Seen from above, the sea looked as if it were rising. And since the veils of the night were advancing
from the east, the city became a sweet abyss burning with pulsating lights. Within it were powerful men, and women who
were even more powerful, furs and violins, cars glossy as onyx, the neon signs of nightclubs, the entrance halls of
darkened mansions, fountains, diamonds, old silent gardens, parties, desires, affairs, and, above all, that consuming
sorcery of the evening which provokes dreams of greatness and glory.\n\n

Seeing these things, Marta hopelessly leaned out over the railing and let herself go. She felt as if she were
hovering in the air, but she was falling. Given the extraordinary height of the skyscraper, the streets and squares down at
the bottom were very far away. Who knows how long it would take her to get there. Yet the girl was falling.
At that hour the terraces and balconies of the top floors were filled with rich and elegant people who were having
cocktails and making silly conversation. They were scattered in crowds, and their talk muffled the music. Marta passed
before them and several people looked out to watch her.\n
Flights of that kind (mostly by girls, in fact) were not rare in the skyscraper and they constituted an interesting
diversion for the tenants; this was also the reason why the price of those apartments was very high.
The sun had not yet completely set and it did its best to illuminate Marta’\s simple clothing. She wore a modest,
inexpensive spring dress bought off the rack. Yet the lyrical light of the sunset exalted it somewhat, making it chic.
From the millionaires\’ balconies, gallant hands were stretched out toward her, offering flowers and cocktails. \“Miss,
would you like a drink? . . . Gentle butterfly, why not stop a minute with us?\”
She laughed, hovering, happy (but meanwhile she was falling): \“No, thanks, friends. I can\’t. I\’m in a hurry.\”
\“Where are you headed?\” they asked her.\n\n

\“Ah, don\’t make me say,\” Marta answered, waving her hands in a friendly good-bye.
A young man, tall, dark, very distinguished, extended an arm to snatch her. She liked him. And yet Marta quickly
defended herself: \“How dare you, sir?\” and she had time to give him a little tap on the nose.
The beautiful people, then, were interested in her and that filled her with satisfaction. She felt fascinating, stylish. On the
flower-filled terraces, amid the bustle of waiters in white and the bursts of exotic songs, there was talk for a few minutes,
perhaps less, of the young woman who was passing by (from top to bottom, on a vertical course). Some thought her
pretty, others thought her so-so, everyone found her interesting.
\“You have your entire life before you,\” they told her, \“why are you in such a hurry? You still have time to rush
around and busy yourself. Stop with us for a little while, it’s only a modest little party among friends, really, you’ll have a
good time.\”\n\n

She made an attempt to answer but the force of gravity had already quickly carried her to the floor below, then
two, three, four floors below; in fact, exactly as you gaily rush around when you are just nineteen years old.
Of course, the distance that separated her from the bottom, that is, from street level, was immense. It is true that
she began falling just a little while ago, but the street always seemed very far away,
In the meantime, however, the sun had plunged into the sea; one could see it disappear, transformed into a
shimmering red dish mushroom. As a result, it no longer emitted its vivifying rays to light up the girl\’s dress and make her
a seductive comet.\n
It was a good thing that the windows and terraces of the skyscraper were almost all illuminated and the bright
reflections completely gilded her as she gradually passed by.
Now Marta no longer saw just groups of carefree people inside the-apartments; at times there were even some
businesses where the employees, in black or blue aprons, were sitting at desks in long rows. Several of them were young
people as old as or older than she, and weary of the day by now, every once in a while they raised their eyes from their
duties and from typewriters.\n\n

In this way they too saw her, and a few ran to the windows. \“Where are you going? Why so fast? Who are you?\”
they shouted to her. One could divine something akin to envy in their words.
\“They\’re waiting for me down there,\” she answered. \“I can\’t stop. Forgive me.\” And again she laughed, wavering
on her headlong fall, but it wasn\’t like her previous laughter anymore. The night had craftily fallen and Marta started to
feel cold.\n\n
Meanwhile, looking downward, she saw a bright halo of lights at the entrance of a building. Here long blacks cars
were stopping (from the great distance they looked as small as ants), and men and women were getting out, anxious to go
inside. She seemed to make out the sparkling of jewels in that swarm. Above the entrance flags were flying.
They were obviously giving a large party, exactly the kind Marta dreamed of ever since she was a child. Heaven
help her if she missed it. \nDown there opportunity was waiting for her, fate, romance, the true inauguration of her life.
Would she arrive in time?
She spitefully noticed that another girl was falling about thirty meters above her. She was decidedly prettier than
Marta and she wore a rather classy evening gown. For some unknown reason she came down much faster than Marta, so
that in a few moments she passed by her and disappeared below, even though Marta was calling her. Without doubt she
would get to the party before Marta; perhaps she had a plan all worked out to supplant her.
Then she realized that they weren\’t alone. Along the sides of the skyscraper many other young women were
plunging downward, their faces taut with the excitement of the flight, their hands cheerfully waving as if to say: look at
us, here we are, entertain us, is not the world ours?
It was a contest, then. \nAnd she only had a shabby little dress while those other girls were dressed smartly like high
fashion models and some even wrapped luxurious mink stoles tightly around their bare shoulders. So self-assured when
she began the leap, Marta now felt a tremor growing inside her; perhaps it was just the cold; but it may have been fear too,
the fear of having made an error without remedy.\n
It seemed to be late at night now. The windows were darkened one after another, the echoes of music became
more rare, the offices were empty, young men no longer leaned out from the windowsills extending their hands. What
time was it? At the entrance to the building down below— which in the meantime had grown larger, and one could now
distinguish all the architectural details—the lights were still burning, but the bustle of cars had stopped. Every now and
then, in fact, small groups of people came out of the main floor wearily drawing away. Then the lights of the entrance
were also turned off.\n
Marta felt her heart tightening. Alas, she wouldn\’t reach the ball in time. Glancing upwards she saw the pinnacle
of the skyscraper in all its cruel power. It was almost completely dark. On the top floors a few windows here and there
were still lit. And above the top the first glimmer of dawn was spreading.
In a dining recess on the twenty-eighth floor a man about forty years old was having his morning coffee and
reading his newspaper while his wife tidied up the room. A clock on the sideboard indicated 8:45. A shadow suddenly
passed before the window.\n
\“Alberto!\” the wife shouted. \“Did you see that? A woman passed by.\”
\“Who was it?\” he said without raising his eyes from the news paper.\n
\“An old woman,\” the wife answered. \“A decrepit old woman. She looked frightened.\”
\“It\’s always like that,\” the man muttered. \“At these low floors only falling old women pass by. You can see
beautiful girls from the hundred floor up. Those apartments don\’t cost so much for nothing.\”
\“At least down here there\’s the advantage,\” observed the wife, “that you can hear the thud when they touch the
ground\”\n
\“This time not even that,\” he said, shaking his head, after he stood listening for a few minutes. Then he had
another sip of coffee.\n\n

        </item>
        <item>
The woman had died without pain, quietly, as a woman should whose life had been blameless.
Now she was resting in her bed, lying on her back, her eyes closed, her features calm,
her long white hair carefully arranged as though she had done it up ten minutes before dying.
The whole pale countenance of the dead woman was so collected, so calm,
so resigned that one could feel what a sweet soul had lived in that body,
what a quiet existence this old soul had led, how easy and pure the death of this parent had been.\n\n

Kneeling beside the bed, her son, a magistrate with inflexible principles, and her daughter,
Marguerite, known as Sister Eulalie, were weeping as though their hearts would break. She had,
from childhood up, armed them with a strict moral code, teaching them religion, without weakness,
and duty, without compromise. He, the man, had become a judge and handled the law as a
weapon with which he smote the weak ones without pity. She, the girl, influenced by the
virtue which had bathed her in this austere family, had become the bride of the
Church through her loathing for man.\n\n

They had hardly known their father, knowing only that he had made their mother most unhappy,
without being told any other details.\n\n

The nun was wildly-kissing the dead woman\'s hand, an ivory hand as white as the large
crucifix lying across the bed. On the other side of the long body the other hand
seemed still to be holding the sheet in the death grasp; and the sheet had preserved the
little creases as a memory of those last movements which precede eternal immobility.\n\n

A few light taps on the door caused the two sobbing heads to look up, and the priest,
who had just come from dinner, returned. He was red and out of breath from his interrupted digestion,
for he had made himself a strong mixture of coffee and brandy in order to combat the
fatigue of the last few nights and of the wake which was beginning.\n\n

He looked sad, with that assumed sadness of the priest for whom death is a bread winner.
He crossed himself and approaching with his professional gesture: \“Well, my poor children!
I have come to help you pass these last sad hours.\” But Sister Eulalie suddenly arose.
\“Thank you, father, but my brother and I prefer to remain alone with her.
This is our last chance to see her, and we wish to be together, all three of us,
as we—we—used to be when we were small and our poor mo—mother——\”

Grief and tears stopped her; she could not continue.\n\n

Once more serene, the priest bowed, thinking of his bed. \“As you wish, my children.\”
He kneeled, crossed himself, prayed, arose and went out quietly, murmuring: \“She was a saint!\”\n\n

They remained alone, the dead woman and her children. The ticking of the clock, hidden in the shadow,
could be heard distinctly, and through the open window drifted in the sweet smell of hay and of woods,
together with the soft moonlight. No other noise could be heard over the land except the occasional
croaking of the frog or the chirping of some belated insect.
An infinite peace, a divine melancholy, a silent serenity surrounded this dead woman,
seemed to be breathed out from her and to appease nature itself.\n\n

Then the judge, still kneeling, his head buried in the bed clothes,
cried in a voice altered by grief and deadened by the sheets and blankets: \“Mamma, mamma, mamma!\” And his sister,
frantically striking her forehead against the woodwork, convulsed, twitching and trembling as in an epileptic fit,
moaned: \“Jesus, Jesus, mamma, Jesus!” And both of them, shaken by a storm of grief, gasped and choked.

\n\nThe crisis slowly calmed down and they began to weep quietly,
just as on the sea when a calm follows a squall.\n\n

A rather long time passed and they arose and looked at their dead. And the memories,
those distant memories, yesterday so dear, to-day so torturing, came to their minds
with all the little forgotten details, those little intimate familiar details which bring back to life the one who has left.
They recalled to each other circumstances, words, smiles, intonations of the mother who was no longer to speak to them.
They saw her again happy and calm. They remembered things which she had said, and a little motion of the hand,
like beating time, which she often used when emphasizing something important.\n\n

And they loved her as they never had loved her before. They measured the depth of their grief,
and thus they discovered how lonely they would find themselves.\n\n

It was their prop, their guide, their whole youth, all the best part of their lives which was disappearing.
It was their bond with life, their mother, their mamma, the connecting link with their forefathers which they would thenceforth miss.
They now became solitary, lonely beings; they could no longer look back.\n\n

The nun said to her brother: “\You remember how mamma used always to read her old letters; they are all there in that drawer.
Let us, in turn, read them; let us live her whole life through tonight beside her!
It would be like a road to the cross, like making the acquaintance of her mother,
of our grandparents, whom we never knew, but whose letters are there and of whom she so often spoke, do you remember?\”

\n\nOut of the drawer they took about ten little packages of yellow paper,
tied with care and arranged one beside the other. They threw these relics on the bed and chose one of them on which the word \“Father\”
was written. They opened and read it.\n\n

It was one of those old-fashioned letters which one finds in old family desk drawers,
those epistles which smell of another century. The first one started:
\“My dear,\” another one: \“My beautiful little girl,\” others: \“My dear child,\” or: \“My dear (laughter).\” And
suddenly the nun began to read aloud, to read over to the dead woman her whole history, all her tender memories.
The judge, resting his elbow on the bed, was listening with his eyes fastened on his mother.
The motionless body seemed happy.\n\n

Sister Eulalie, interrupting herself, said suddenly:\n\n

“These ought to be put in the grave with her; they ought to be used as a shroud and she ought to be buried in it.\”
She took another package, on which no name was written. She began to read in a firm voice: \“My adored one, I love you wildly.
Since yesterday I have been suffering the tortures of the damned, haunted by our memory.
I feel your lips against mine, your eyes in mine, your breast against mine. I love you,
I love you! You have driven me mad. My arms open, I gasp, moved by a wild desire to hold you again.
My whole soul and body cries out for you, wants you. I have kept in my mouth the taste of your kisses—\”

\n\nThe judge had straightened himself up. The nun stopped reading.
He snatched the letter from her and looked for the signature.
There was none, but only under the words, \“The man who adores you,\” the name \“Henry.\” Their father\'s name was Rene.
Therefore this was not from him. The son then quickly rummaged through the package of letters,
took one out and read: \“I can no longer live without your caresses.\” Standing erect,
severe as when sitting on the bench, he looked unmoved at the dead woman.
The nun, straight as a statue, tears trembling in the corners of her eyes,
was watching her brother, waiting. Then he crossed the room slowly, went to the window and stood there,
gazing out into the dark night.\n\n

When he turned around again Sister Eulalie,
her eyes dry now, was still standing near the bed, her head bent down.\n\n

He stepped forward, quickly picked up the letters and threw them pell-mell back into the drawer.
Then he closed the curtains of the bed.\n\n

When daylight made the candles on the table turn pale the son slowly left his armchair,
and without looking again at the mother upon whom he had passed sentence,
severing the tie that united her to son and daughter, he said slowly: \“Let us now retire,sister\"\n\n

One fine evening, a no less fine government clerk called Ivan Dmitritch Tchervyakov
was sitting in the second row of the stalls, gazing through an opera glass at the Cloches de Corneville.
He gazed and felt at the acme of bliss.\n
But suddenly. . . . \nIn stories one so often meets with this \"But suddenly."\
The authors are right: life is so full of surprises! But suddenly his face puckered up,
his eyes disappeared, his breathing was arrested . . . he took the opera glass from his eyes,
bent over and . . . \n\"Aptchee!!\" he sneezed as you perceive.
It is not reprehensible for anyone to sneeze anywhere.\n
Peasants sneeze and so do police superintendents, and sometimes even privy councillors.
All men sneeze. Tchervyakov was not in the least confused,
he wiped his face with his handkerchief, and like a polite man,
looked round to see whether he had disturbed any one by his sneezing.
But then he was overcome with confusion.\n
He saw that an old gentleman sitting in front of him in the first row of the stalls
was carefully wiping his bald head and his neck with his glove and muttering something to himself.
In the old gentleman, Tchervyakov recognised Brizzhalov, a civilian general serving in the Department of Transport.\n

"I have spattered him,\" thought Tchervyakov, \"he is not the head of my department,
but still it is awkward. I must apologise.\"\n

Tchervyakov gave a cough, bent his whole person forward, and whispered in the general\'s ear.\n

\"Pardon, your Excellency, I spattered you accidentally. . . .\"\n

\"Never mind, never mind.\"\n

\"For goodness sake excuse me, I . . . I did not mean to.\"

\"Oh, please, sit down! let me listen!\"\n

Tchervyakov was embarrassed, he smiled stupidly and fell to gazing at the stage.
He gazed at it but was no longer feeling bliss. He began to be troubled by uneasiness.
In the interval, he went up to Brizzhalov, walked beside him, and overcoming his shyness, muttered:\n

\"I spattered you, your Excellency, forgive me . . . you see . . . I didn\'t do it to . . . .\"\n


\"Oh, that\'s enough . . . I\'d forgotten it, and you keep on about it!\" said the general,
moving his lower lip impatiently.\n

\"He has forgotten, but there is a fiendish light in his eye,\" thought Tchervyakov, looking suspiciously at the general.
\"And he doesn\'t want to talk. I ought to explain to him . . . that
I really didn\'t intend . . . that it is the law of nature or else he will think
I meant to spit on him. He doesn\'t think so now, but he will think so later!\"\n

On getting home, Tchervyakov told his wife of his breach of good manners. It struck him that his
wife took too frivolous a view of the incident; she was a little frightened,
but when she learned that Brizzhalov was in a different department, she was reassured.\n

\"Still, you had better go and apologise,\" she said, \"or he will think you don\'t know how to behave in public.\"\n

\"That\'s just it! I did apologise, but he took it somehow queerly . . . he didn\'t say a word of sense.
There wasn\'t time to talk properly.\"\n

Next day Tchervyakov put on a new uniform, had his hair cut and went to Brizzhalov\'s to
explain; going into the general\'s reception room he saw there a number of
petitioners and among them the general himself, who was beginning to interview them.
After questioning several petitioners the general raised his eyes and looked at Tchervyakov.\n

\"Yesterday at the Arcadia, if you recollect, your Excellency,\" the\n

latter began, \"I sneezed and . . . accidentally spattered . . . Exc. . . .\"\n

\"What nonsense. . . . It\'s beyond anything! What can I do for you,\" said the general
addressing the next petitioner.\n

\"He won\'t speak,\" thought Tchervyakov, turning pale; \"that means that he is angry. . . . No,
it can\'t be left like this. . . . I will explain to him.\"\n

When the general had finished his conversation with the last of the petitioners and was turning towards
his inner apartments, Tchervyakov took a step towards him and muttered:\n

\"Your Excellency! If I venture to trouble your Excellency, it is simply from a feeling I may say of regret! . . .
It was not intentional if you will graciously believe me.\"\n

The general made a lachrymose face, and waved his hand.\n


\"Why, you are simply making fun of me, sir,\" he said as he closed the door behind him.\n

\"Where\'s the making fun in it?\" thought Tchervyakov, \"there is nothing of the sort!
He is a general, but he can\'t understand. If that is how it is
I am not going to apologise to that The Death of a Government Clerk\n

fanfaron any more! The devil take him. I\'ll write a letter to him, but I won\'t go.
By Jove, I won\'t."\n

So thought Tchervyakov as he walked home; he did not write a letter to the general,
he pondered and pondered and could not make up that letter. He had to go next day to explain in person.

\"I ventured to disturb your Excellency yesterday,\" he muttered,
when the general lifted enquiring eyes upon him, \"not to make fun as you were pleased to say.
I was apologising for having spattered you in sneezing. . . . And I did not dream of making fun of you.
Should I dare to make fun of you, if we should take to making fun, then there would be no respect for persons,
there would be. . . .\"

\"Be off!\" yelled the general, turning suddenly purple, and shaking all over.

\"What?\" asked Tchervyakov, in a whisper turning numb with horror.

\"Be off!\" repeated the general, stamping.


Something seemed to give way in Tchervyakov\'s stomach. Seeing nothing and hearing nothing he reeled to the door,
went out into the street, and went staggering along. . . . Reaching home
mechanically, without taking off his uniform, he lay down on the sofa and died.\n

        <item>


Each day John descended nine flights of stairs in building C of the projects because the elevator stuck months ago and was never fixed. Halfway down he stumbled gripping the railing to prevent a fall. Stairs were never easy; congenital defects fused his skeleton in odd places and he limped with an arched back and a withered leg.

\n\nFifteen minutes later he boarded the city bus at Martin Luther King Blvd and 27th Street for the hour-long ride to the university. Night still lingered when he banged on the double front doors of the indoor tennis center until security arrived to let him in. Inside, from the utility closet, he hurriedly gathered mop and broom, a slop pail, cleaning rags, and a spatula for scraping up gum before entering the member’s lounge, always empty at this hour. He found the remote to the wall-mounted TV under a sofa pillow and tuned to his favorite cartoon show. He laughed out loud at his cartoon friends’ impossible antics and jerky movements so much like his own.

\n\nThe entrance hall and corridors were mopped clean when employees began to arrive and, with broom and dustpan in hand, he climbed stairs to sweep the observation platform that overlooked the court where four men played. On the change of ends the men paused near the net pole to talk and joke.

\n\n“Hey, John!” one yelled as he arched a ball toward John with a solid hit of the racquet. John reached out, his broom clacking on the floor, but he was too far away to catch and the ball rolled into a corner. John waved. “Hey, boss,” he said.

\n\n“Try again,” the man called out as he hit another ball, much harder this time. It went between John’s outstretched hands landing a sharp, burning pain on his chest; he stifled a gasp to appear unaffected.

\n\n“You aren’t getting any better,” the man taunted. The words hurt John more than the bruise on his chest but he would never complain; he craved the slightest attention as a welcome diversion from his routines. He gripped his broom and swept; the men played on.

\n\nAt the noon lunch hour, John hobbled along the recently-shoveled, paved path that meandered through plots of snow-tinged dormant grass and scattered evergreens until he came to a small, ice-encrusted lake. A few feet from the water’s edge, he sat on his favorite forged-iron bench, one of many facing the water that circled the lake.

\n\nA small shoal of fish gathered—brim, trout, perch, carp—and angled up to look at him, their mouths gaping, their gills pulsing in anticipation. From his pocket, John threw crumbs and scraps of discarded food he’d picked from the dumpster behind the tennis center. He sniggered as tails propelled bodies forward and mouths broke the surface with swirls and splashes; in seconds, movement ceased, and all fish pointed in unison at him again in a pregnant calm. When he’d emptied his pocket, all fish left except for a gray-black koi that lazily held its position. John felt camaraderie in the line of that fish’s unwavering gaze.

\n\nThat night John shivered in the chill of his grandmother’s government-subsidized two-room apartment. Grandma was his only family for the eight years after his parents and baby sister died in a car crash when he was twelve. A visiting every-other-day nurse gave grandma injections for diabetes and infections and monitored her high blood pressure and irregular pulse. But there were no other visitors.

\n\nJohn ate at a small table near the kitchenette that had a knee-high refrigerator on the floor and a white, four-burner electric stove next to a sink with drainpipes exposed. He sorted through leftover scraps from his grandmother’s welfare meals delivered on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. On Sunday, his day off, he walked a mile to the canteen for the poor at the Cathedral and ate chicken-flavored bullion noodle soup with carrot chunks—sometimes partially-thawed peas. For grandma, he carried home a cheese-and-mayonnaise sandwich on stale bread wrapped in a paper napkin that she rarely accepted and he usually ate at day’s end.

\n\nA half-hour after dark, John kicked off his shoes to lie on his canvas camping cot that was against the wall and close to grandma’s always open door. He pulled a wadded, threadbare wedding-ring quilt over himself and positioned a coverless, crumpled feather pillow under his head. He was asleep in minutes.

\n\n“John! Bring my heating pad,” his grandmother shouted.

\n\nJohn turned over.

\n\n“Did you hear me?”

\n\n“I coming,” he mumbled, still groggy.

\n\nHis grandmother’s crank-up hospital bed, angled upright so she could breathe better, filled her room; an always-on seventeen-inch portable TV sat on the dresser. Wadded wet tissues soiled with yellow-brown, blood-flecked sputum, scattered white-screw-top pill plastic containers, and a chipped porcelain coffee cup covered the bedside nightstand. The air smelled of stale cigarette smoke, dry skin, and soiled linens. He felt neither love nor affection for her, only vague worries that her scathing words might make him feel bad for causing her displeasure.

\n\n“Hurry. Don’t make me get of bed,” she said when she saw him. “I don’t feel up to it tonight.”

\n\nA few days later, John returned home from work; grandma was gone.

\n\n“She dead,” the project’s night attendant said. “They took her away.”

\n\nJohn had no skills to ask for help or plan for the unknown, so he sat on the floor, his back against the hall wall, waiting for something to happen. Finally, a neighbor gave him two cold fried chicken legs and told him to sleep in that big chair in the first-floor entrance hall. “Not good to be in the place where she died,” she said.

\n\nHe went to work the next day. When he returned, his few possessions were scattered in the hall outside the apartment; grandma’s brother had taken all the valuables and cash and John had been evicted. The neighbor said she couldn’t feed him anymore, and the night attendant refused to let him sleep in that chair on the first floor. At the bus stop the next morning, the driver turned John away when he didn’t have enough money for the fare.

\n\nAt first, John begged for food until he learned to scavenge half-eaten meals from restaurant garbage bins and pick through overflowing trashcans waiting for pickup. Because warm spots were hard to find in residential sections, he slept mostly in business district doorways. He wandered for days trying to find the university and when someone finally answered his knock on the tennis-center door, he’d lost his job. He never thought about grandma.

\n\nOne dark night near a high school, he bundled up in the entrance to the auditorium, avoiding closeness to a human lump-form of feminine clothing and blankets on the other side of the passage that didn’t move as he settled in.  A brown lab-collie-mix dog next to the form stared at him for a few seconds, then put its head back on its paws and closed its eyes.



\n\nMollie McGuire woke slowly, sweeping her scraggly faded brown hair from her scarred and red-blotched once pretty face. She rubbed her withered blue eyes with the heels of her palms. She tensed. A heap of wadded blankets with a purple-cardigan-covered arm sticking out half blocked the door to the auditorium entrance. The heap wriggled and a man sat up.

\n\n“Who are you?” she asked. She’d never seen such a sight of mismatched basketball shoes, ripped cargo pants, and at least two tee shirts under a gray sweatshirt. He had to be harmless. His blank face, gaping mouth, loose lips, and slow-moving, vacant, washed-out green eyes, made him look abandoned.

\n\nShe rubbed the ear of the lab lying beside her.

\n\n“Don’t you talk?” she asked.

\n\nHe blinked slowly once.

\n\n“Goddamn it. Say something. What’s your name?”

\n\n“Jha . . . John,” he said.

\n\n“That’s all? You’re just John?”

\n\nHer dog rose and sniffed John’s crotch, then nuzzled his outstretched hand. “Stop it, Bunkie,” Mollie said.

\n\nBunkie lay down again next to her. “What’s your whole name, for Christ’s sake?”

\n\n“John Plumb,” he said.

\n\nGod, he’s stupid, she thought.

\n\n“You got money?” she asked.

\n\nJohn obediently reached in his pocket and found a dollar bill and change that she scooped up from his open hand.

\n\n“That all you got?” she asked. John didn’t move. She’d not expected him to just give her money, but now she had $4.87, enough for an egg and cheese biscuit and a small coffee. She kept the money.

\n\nShe got up tucking her blankets into a shopping cart overstuffed with bedding, pots and pans, a poncho, an orange traffic cone, two postal cardboard mailing cylinders, a bag of pet food, and two unwashed towels. “Look. With your money we got enough for both of us to eat. But you’re an idiot to be giving stuff away. You gotta take care of yourself, man; you won’t last. It’s a shitty world.”

\n\nJohn hadn’t spoken to many people on the streets and he’d always been hesitant to speak to girls, and he couldn’t respond now. But he rubbed the dog behind the ear and was rewarded with a friendly nudge.

\n\n“Come, Bunkie,” she said to the dog as she moved away with her cart. “Mind what I say,” she said to John, who still hadn’t moved. “And hustle up!”

\n\nJohn clutched his belongings and followed.

\n\nMollie got sick with a flu, then her period came and made her feel worse, so she slipped away from John while he was begging and camped out in the basement of an abandoned auto-parts store. Two scavenged, rogue electric-heaters kept the place almost tolerable and with bad weather there were always a few homeless bundled up and sleeping on the floor.

\n\nFor five days she left the hideout only to forage for food with Bunkie. On the fifth day, John came in through the back entrance. He carried a creased and torn cardboard flap from a large packing box to keep him warm and he settled in a dark corner, away from the center where three men congregated near the heaters. John waved to her but she didn’t respond.

\n\nA youth entered and planted his backpack on a dry spot on the damp dirt floor. He squinted in a darkness interrupted only by the glow from the wire coils of the heaters and took out a wooden nightstick a foot and a half long, raising it head-high in front of him. He faced John. “Who in the hell are you?” he snarled.

\n\nJohn grinned.

\n\n“What’s funny? You think I’m funny?”

\n\n“You funny,” John parroted, unable to think of anything to say.

\n\nThe youth swung the nightstick at John’s head; John’s arm jerked up to parry the blow.

\n\n“Got no money,” John said, and grinned wider in an attempt at friendship. He’d been accosted many times.

\n\nThe youth perceived derision in John’s vacuous smile and it inflamed him. “Liar,” he said.

\n\n“No money,” John said again.

\n\nThe youth pummeled John with the nightstick.

\n\n“Oh, no,” Mollie moaned. She was on her feet in an instant. “Stop,” she screamed. She bent to pick up the aluminum walking stick she carried for protection. “He doesn’t know what you mean.”

\n\n“Shut up.” The youth aimed another blow at John’s head, but John’s arms flailed, knocking the nightstick out of the youth’s grasp.

\n\nJohn bent down to pick up the stick and hand it back. “I sorry,” he said.

\n\n“You little shit.” The youth raised the nightstick to hit John again.

\n\nMollie closed in, lifting the walking stick high above her head with both hands. “He’s trying to do you a favor!” With perfectly timed swings she bludgeoned the skull. Blood spurted from the scalp as the youth crumpled to his knees.

\n\n“You asshole,” Mollie said. Nose bones crackled when she swung at his face. He uttered a weak moan and fell, his blood mixing with floor dirt in a dark stain.

\n\nTwo homeless men stared. Mollie rolled the youth over.

\n\n“He’s dead,” one said.

\n\n“He’s not dead,” Mollie snapped. “He’s breathing.”

\n\n“I’m getting out,” the man said.

\n\n“Me too,” the other agreed.

\n\nMollie didn’t hesitate. “Get your stuff,” she said to John. She packed what she could into a backpack and wrapped the rest in the blankets that she knotted on the top as a carryall. She left her shopping cart.

\n\nThe four hurried in single file, keeping in the shadows and avoiding the few people they saw. It still rained. Mollie borrowed a burner from one of the men and called 911 to report the youth’s location before the men left in different directions.

\n\n“Take this,” she said to John, handing him her blanket carryall so they could move faster. Side by side they headed down alleys, across a park, and down side streets until they came to a main thoroughfare. Traffic was sparse. Stores were closed. Dark, low-lying clouds obliterated the sky.

\n\nThey climbed a hill, passing homeless in doorways and on the street in the angles where buildings met the cement sidewalk. Mollie found a doorway big enough for the both of them. They settled in quickly.

\n\n“Why you crying?” she asked John.

\n\n“That man hurt.”

\n\nShe shook her head. “Go to sleep. He’s not worth thinking about.”

\n\nBut John still worried about the youth’s pain. And he didn’t sleep well.

\n\nAt nine o’clock in the morning an irate store owner threatened police arrest as he rousted Mollie and John. Mollie had enough money to share donuts and coffee from a convenience store, then she headed for a mall to panhandle. John followed without question or invitation, living moment by moment, neither sad nor happy, and holding on to a few faded memories of a past that meant nothing. He knew neither regret or jealousy. Frustration irritated him but not injustice or attack, and he rarely felt anger. And he willingly followed Mollie; he felt safe around her.

\n\nMollie and John sat on a concrete park bench, their stuff to the side and Bunkie near Mollie’s feet, front paws out, head down. Mollie asked John: “How much you make today?”

\n\nJohn showed two bills and a handful of small change.

\n\n“That’s shit,” she said. She used a black magic marker to freshen the print on her cardboard sign. “Please Help / Homeless and Lost.”

\n\n“Humanity sucks,” she said.

\n\nJohn didn’t respond.

\n\n“Goddamn it, John. Say something. Anything. You’re not stupid. It’s like working with a stone.”

\n\n“Not stupid,” John said, totally unaware of the concepts Mollie’s words carried. “Tree” was a tree for John; he didn’t conjure images in his mind, he just knew what a word meant. But “stupid” was a word too abstract and it brought no meaning to his consciousness.

\n\nHe doesn’t know what it means to be alive, for Christ’s sake, she thought. “Look, you meatball, start responding when people talk to you. Make them think you’re feeling something. Get connected.”

\n\nJohn said nothing.

\n\n“Just try. I said ‘humanity sucks.’ Say ‘yes’ or ‘okay.’ Something. Anything.”

\n\nJohn stared.

\n\n“Say ‘yes’!” she said loudly, without a response. She shrieked with frustration. “It’s ‘yes,’ goddammit!”

\n\n“Yes,” John said timidly.

\n\n“Like this.” She enunciated “yes.” She urged him on . . . he tried many times. “That’s better,” she finally said.

\n\nFor the next hour she exaggerated word pronunciations with active lips and a lively tongue. He listened. At times his eyes showed a faint spark of cognition, and from that day on she taught him before begging, and felt ballooning satisfaction when she saw his mounting eagerness to keep trying. He’s improving! she thought.

\n\nIn time, he responded sometimes to people they knew, not always with logic, but with a touch of verve. And he seemed to emote, in dollops it was true, but with absolute honesty. He liked Bunkie and told her “you good dog.” He got irritated when he couldn’t think of words, and said he was afraid when assaulted by bullies. But most of all, he had feelings now, and he was responding. The instruction continued.

\n\nOn a cloudy day, waiting outside a soup kitchen on the south side, Mollie stood in front of John in a food line, Bunkie obediently at her side. Mollie and John were unwashed with uncut straggly hair and dirt under their fingernails. Twenty minutes later they’d progressed to a table attended by a male volunteer handing out paper bowls and plates, and plastic utensils. “Sorry,” the man said, “come back when you’ve cleaned up.”

\n\nMollie’s shame lasted only an instant until anger overwhelmed her.

\n\n“Cleaned up,” John parroted, proud of his response.

\n\n“Damn it, John. This guy’s an asshole.” Mollie spat on the table. “Get angry. Let him know you don’t like what he’s doing.”

\n\nJohn stopped grinning, his face blank.

\n\n“I feel like punching this bastard in the nose. I want to hurt him. Make him know he’s a jerk.”

\n\nThe man’s face reddened as he clenched his fists, his knuckles white.

\n\n“Jerk,” John said nervously, reaching to rub Bunkie’s ear.

\n\n“Move on,” the man said.

\n\n“Bad man,” John said when he and Mollie were a few yards away.

\n\n“Yes, John!” Mollie held up her grimy fist in a gesture of winning. “Get angry. Don’t let them run over you, man. Fight back!” He understands. It’s been worth it, she thought. He’ll survive in the downside now, and maybe, someday, God willing, he’ll find the upside.

\n\n“Let’s go to the Fluffy Pancake,” she said. “I could use a cup of coffee,”

\n\n“Coffee,” John said.

\n\n“What do you think about coffee, John?”

\n\n“Coffee good.”

\n\nMollie smiled. “That’s the way.” She stopped and held John back by the arm; then, on tiptoe, she gave him a kiss on the cheek. “Good job,” she said, proud he was making judgments about things.

\n\nOne January night the temperature crept enough above freezing that they could sleep in the open near the river. Dark clouds spotted the moonless sky, and shadows blended into shapes. Mollie, rolled up in her sleeping bag on her side with her down coat under her head, could barely see John, bundled up a few feet away, even though she could hear him breathing. He was awake. God, she needed to talk. He wouldn’t understand, but she had to tell him anyway, to ease the pain of being alone this night. She began:

\n\n“I saw this guy a couple weeks ago who looked like a guy I knew when I was in college. This guy lit up and leaned over to me, maybe six, seven inches from my face. ‘I’ve been clean for six months,’ I said. ‘Don’t do this to me.’ And he blew a cloud and I was like heading for nirvana again. I began to like this guy a lot, as if he’d seeped into my present from my past when I could love. Those were great days in college, John, days of expectation and yearning to be satisfied, and the belief that nothing could ever go wrong for me. But I didn’t do it right. I shared pleasures and ignored responsibilities to prepare for my future. And this jerk was the devil, making me lose it all again.”

\n\n“John. You awake?” She leaned over to pick up her walking stick and poked the middle of his bundled-up form. “You in there?”

\n\n“I’m here.”

\n\nShe smiled. He was there and he was awake and responding like he knew what the hell was going on in the world. She had to continue.

\n\n“He wouldn’t stop coming at me. His hand found my breast and I didn’t push him away. ‘I got good stuff, baby,’ he said. He put a joint to my mouth. I lost all the resistance I’d built up for months. Two weeks later I went back to him. ‘I need,’ I said. ‘I like you,’ he said, ‘but I ain’t no Samaritan.’ He held out his hand and rubbed his thumb and middle finger together like he wanted cash. But my four bucks wasn’t nearly enough. Then he said it outright: if I let him screw me, he’d give me as much as I needed. ‘I got a kid,’ I said. ‘I got a future.’ ‘You beautiful, baby,’ he said. I was so desperate, John. I did it.

\n\nMollie cried silently. John was long asleep and made no sound. She wasn’t a whore, why was she doing this? But she couldn’t stop. In a rush of shame, she packed up and left.

\n\nJohn woke before dawn. Mollie had disappeared with all her stuff and Bunkie. He’d heard her talking about her man-friend, sensed the anguish but forgot most of the words he understood. Still, he was sad.

\n\nHe panhandled for days, always looking for Mollie; she was never in the places he expected. He depended on her; she guided him through thinking about things. He couldn’t manage crisp thoughts yet. Thoughts were more like rainwater slipping down a storm drain. But he felt alive when he thought about Mollie, only five percent alive by most standards, but he’d come to believe life had filled to his brim.

\n\nAfter more than a week, he found Mollie with five homeless men and a woman in a two-car garage behind a user-artist’s studio. Mollie’s man-friend was there; John knew him by the way he touched her real friendly. Man-friend fed the party dudes, too, like a boss man.

\n\nSoon stagnant humans lay on the concrete floor—crumpled up, wrapped in blankets and coats, relaxed, eyes glazed, most taking hits from a joint being passed. Mollie, too. John waved but Mollie didn’t respond; still his heart warmed on seeing her.

\n\nJohn found free-space for sleeping under a workbench covered with tools and lengths of pipe and two-by-fours. He bundled up and was almost asleep when Mollie’s scream and moan jolted him awake. Her man-friend punched her in the face, kicked her in her groin with the pointed toe of a cowboy boot. Mollie screamed again. The garage went silent with stares and held-breath. For the first time, anger seized John. His face flushed, his heart pounded, his muscles tensed. He grabbed the nearest section of lead pipe as he climbed out from under the workbench and roared a long screech of hate. In six steps he closed in on the man-friend, swinging the pipe at his head. The skull cracked. The next swing hit full face and the man fell back on the floor. John hit him again.

\n\nWind and rain grated against the aluminum siding of the garage, but inside the air was motionless and silent. People scrambled for the door. A few minutes later, the body of the man-friend sprawled on the floor alone, blood congealing, eyes wide and opaque, drooled saliva drying on the edge of the gaping mouth.


\n\nThe court appointed Rebecca Abramowitz Esq. the public pro bono defense lawyer for John. Within days she became more emotionally involved with the defense than she had intended. John was handicapped and incompetent, guilty of consequence but innocent of action. She was determined to deliver justice.

\n\nAt trial, two videos from in-garage security cameras detailed the blows to the head and brought moans of aversion from jurors and the public alike. John faced the death penalty.

\n\nInvestigators learned of Mollie’s connection to John, and when Mollie approached Rebecca to ask if she could help, Rebecca took her for coffee in a shop near the courthouse. “Would you testify?” Rebecca asked. “About John’s character. Who John is.”

\n\n“Of course,” Mollie said.

\n\n“How he thinks? What motivates him?”

\n\n“He was surviving, wandering the streets alone,” Mollie said. “It scared me sometimes; he never seemed emotional.”

\n\n“Did you have a relationship with him?”

\n\nMollie bristled. “I didn’t screw him, of that’s what you mean. He’s only a child.”

\n\n“Is he violent?”

\n\n“No,” Mollie answered. “He’s not complicated.”

\n\n“Why did he attack?”

\n\n“Not to kill,” Mollie said.

\n\n“The guy was beating you.”

\n\n“John is not a killer!”

\n\n“But the prosecution knows you were prostituting for drugs. Was John jealous?”

\n\n“He doesn’t have it in him.”

\n\n“Really? He yelled at the victim just before he landed the first blow. You can see it on the tape.”

\n\n“He isn’t capable of jealousy!”

\n\n“You were friends, weren’t you? Was it revenge?”

\n\n“We panhandled for survival. That’s not exactly friends. But I liked him.”

\n\n“No one provoked him, did they?”

\n\nMollie shrugged.

\n\n“The two of you threatened the volunteer at the soup kitchen.”

\n\n“He was an asshole. Called us unclean. Turned us away.”

\n\n“You threatened him with violence.”

\n\n“No. It was unfair. There were losers in that line a lot dirtier than us. I just spit at him. John didn’t do anything.”

\n\n“You live in a culture of violence. Everything you say points to motive and opportunity for John. Did you know John was going to do this?” Rebecca asked.

\n\n“I hadn’t seen him for weeks.”

\n\n“Did you ever encourage him in any way?”

\n\n“No!”

\n\n“John saw you strike a youth in the head with a walking stick,” Rebecca said. “The boy remembers the details.”

\n\n“John was faultless.”

\n\n“But he saw your violence.”

\n\n“John’s action wasn’t planned, counsellor!”

\n\n“It will be hard for a jury to believe that.” Rebecca said.

\n\n“I taught him how to stand up for himself. Fight back. What’s wrong with that?” Mollie looked away to stare at the ground. “He reacted to an injustice, you know,” she said quietly.

\n\n“He reacted to violence against you.”

\n\n“A reflex,” Mollie said.

\n\nUnsettled by the dark pain of guilt that had emerged deep in Mollie’s eyes, Rebecca shrugged. I can’t use her, she thought. She won’t mean to, but she’ll convict him. She quickly terminated their talk.

\n\nLate in the trial, John’s nonchalant demeanor and constant grinning, at times humming abstractly, infuriated the prosecutor, who perceived the behavior as intentional, satiric disrespect. Rebecca unsuccessfully argued that John had reacted, not planned to hurt or kill, and was incapable of understanding the severity of his action. The trial dragged on. The verdict? Guilty as charged.



\n\nRebecca visited John in prison, “Mollie?” was John’s first word.

\n\nRebecca searched for words. “Mollie’s gone, John.”

\n\n“Gone?”

\n\n“She won’t be back. Do you understand?”

\n\n“Won’t be back,” he mumbled. His forlorn eyes were deep with feeling.

\n\nRebecca had sought out Mollie to verify the details of the incident for an upcoming appeal. But Mollie was dead from a heroin overdose. Authorities labeled it accidental, but Rebecca wondered what had happened.

\n\nShe just sat with John for more than an hour. He slumped in his chair, his ankle chained to an iron ring cemented in the floor, and looked down. But she was sure he appreciated her presence. Words were not needed. Minutes after she left, guards confiscated the box of chocolates she’d brought as a gift for John.

\n\nJohn survived a year and two months in prison. His subdued behavior and obliging responses enraged a fanatically deranged inmate who believed John was the incarnate antichrist in masquerade. In the exercise yard, the inmate plunged a makeshift knife into John’s chest to stop the heart and gouged both eyes to cease the soul.

Tuesday, the old cardboard shipping box with UPS tracking labels left outside Sarah Tanner’s door by the building manager came from Florida. Masking tape fortified the torn edges and black-marker blotted out the original California wine company logo and on the top were coffee-stained partial circles from coffee-cup rims. She briefly worried the box might be a threat; she was afraid of everything lately after her divorce. She cut the carelessly applied transparent tape that sealed the top; she folded back the flaps. She rummaged items from a camping trip: a backpack, water bottles, a toilet kit, extra hiking socks. Every item evoked memories of her fervent, secret affair with Peter Musconi more than twenty-five years ago.

\n\nIn the bottom of the box was a business envelope with no markings, the flap sealed with Scotch tape.  She opened it.  A white-gold engagement ring dropped to the floor. A faceted diamond, perfect color, no inclusions, and more than a carat, glittered rare value. Pristine without blemishes. She picked it up, clutched it in her hand.  It’s how she remembered the perfection of her affair with Peter Musconi.  Pristine.

\n\nShe’d never seen this ring before but knew it was meant for her. Their love for each other had been interrupted by the suddenness and immediacy of the breakup; Peter believed she’d been unfaithful … unfounded, but circumstantial evidence delivered in rumor and innuendo had convinced him otherwise.

\n\nShe sat and put her head back on the armless metal kitchen chair to stare at the blistered paint on the ceiling.  Almost everything about Peter, his kindness, his caring, returned to her with edged clarity.  And the longing resurfaced … began to consume her again. Tears blurred her vision. It was easier to ignore Peter when she was still dutifully caring for her husband Carl and her daughter Carmen. But Carl, a surgeon ready to retire, lived alone after the divorce in his three-room apartment, and Carmen was a medical student in training and lived near the hospital.

\n\nThe quiet of this post-divorce rented apartment now irritated her. She turned on a radio near the sink. She sat again and leaned forward resting her forehead on her arms.  Many minutes passed before she reached for the phone to call the name, Richard Conway, on the return label on the box.

\n\nRichard Conway, a probate lawyer in Florida, was not available for phone conversation at first. When he finally did respond, he was unfriendly. Mr. Musconi was dying, he said. Leukemia. He had made up a will for Musconi. “He asked me to find this box. I had to crawl below ground to a storage-bin beneath his apartment.”

\n\nShe needed to believe Peter still cared. That he hadn’t forgotten. That she had misjudged him. “There was an expensive ring,” she ventured.

\n\n“I do probate. I barely know him.”

\n\n“It’s probably worth at least ten thousand dollars. Is that a mistake or what?”

\n\nMr. Conway was silent.

\n\n“Can I talk to him?”

\n\n“He’s on a respirator most of the time. He mouths a few words. But he mostly writes on a pad.”

\n\n“Would you ask him about the ring?” she asked.

\n\n“I’m finished with him. The will is finalized.”

\n\n“Where is he? What hospital?”

\n\n“Near Sarasota,” he said. He reluctantly looked up the address. “Goodbye,” he said abruptly.

\n\nIn the morning she chose her white blouse, black skirt and matching jacket, to attend the evening faculty meeting after work without having to come home to change.  Later that night, she had to meet daughter Carmen. A rumor circulated that Carmen was dating a man her father’s age, the Chairman of Psychiatry at the University where Sarah worked as a scientist. Hospital and school policies prohibited faculty dating students. The policy prevented favoritism that might result in costly legal action. If Carmen persisted, scandal could strangle her career, and her lover’s.

\n\nSarah was afraid to intervene, afraid to risk the last of her barely existent parental control. But Carmen no longer accepted her father’s calls, and her father had insisted Sarah talk to Carmen—he was angry and frustrated with Carmen’s denials, irate at her irrational behavior.

\n\nAfter faculty meeting, Sarah took a cab to Carmen’s apartment. Carmen was not home so Sarah dined at a deli alone and then let herself in to wait. Finally, just before midnight, Carmen arrived and immediately expressed resentment of her mother’s unwelcome visit; Carmen obviously suspected Sarah’s purpose and delayed their talk with hyperactivity and silence, finally spending many minutes behind the closed bathroom door. Sarah waited anxiously, sitting cross-legged on a throw rug, proud at sixty-one she could bend like a teenager.

\n\nCarmen emerged from the bathroom in pajamas and a robe and settled into a place on the love seat. The lights were off. Carmen preferred the dim light that seeped through the window from the street with a half drawn shade.

\n\nSarah asked about Carmen’s rotation at the hospital. Carmen did not respond–her face barely visible–perched on the love seat, her left leg up, her right foot positioned to relieve chronic pain she had from a congenital deformity of the lower spine. Sarah never suppressed her worry about the imperfection, even though she’d been told by many she was blameless, that some handed-down gene or some accident during the pregnancy was not responsible.

\n\nCarmen gasped with pain and changed position.

\n\n“Can I get you a pillow?” Sarah asked.

\n\n“I don’t need a pillow, mother. I need to go to bed.”

\n\n“It’s not me, Carmen. I didn’t come to irritate you. Your father thinks we need to talk.”

\n\n“It’s not negotiable.”

\n\nBelow the window shade a dim glow from a neon bank-sign across the street outlined shapes in the room, but did not throw shadows. Icy rain pelted the windows. The joint tip between Carmen’s thumb and forefinger glowed as she inhaled.

\n\n“We’re in love.” Carmen said.

\n\nSarah paused.  “It can’t work, Carmen.”

\n\n“We’re discrete.”

\n\n“His wife knows!”

\n\n“He doesn’t love her. I don’t think he ever did.”

\n\n“Married professors can’t love students,” Sarah said.

\n\n“My God, mother. What difference does that make?”

\n\n“It’s against school policy … it’s immoral.”

\n\n“He’s going to separate …”

\n\nSarah leaned back on the floor, put her hands behind her head, crossed her legs as Carmen stared. She worried Carmen would see her flexibility as a taunt. She sat again with her arms around her knees. “He told the committee it was over,” she said.  “I heard it at work. They warned him. He denied any wrongdoing. I heard from one committee member they almost recommended his dismissal.”

\n\n“He has to say that. Until his divorce is final.”

\n\nSarah waited. “Your father won’t support you if this goes on. He told me to tell you.”

\n\nCarmen hissed with disgust. “How could you let him do that?”

\n\n“I have no say with your father. You won’t answer his calls, Carmen. He needed me to tell you.”

\n\nCarmen scrapped the butt dead in an ashtray. She closed her eyes. “You’ll support the tuition,” she said. “You have to do that.”

\n\nSarah hesitated. “I don’t have that kind of money, Carmen.”

\n\n“Make him do it, then. What’s different? I’m his daughter.”

\n\n“You’re having an adulterous affair. No one approves. He thinks you’re ruining your life.”

\n\n“And you?  What do you think?”

\n\nIt’s crazy, Sarah didn’t say. You’re blinded by lust for an older man that is attracted to your youth. There is no permanency in that. You’re doomed to pain and humiliation. “I think you’re making a serious mistake,” she said.

\n\n“As if you’re some expert. What the fuck would you know about love? I’d never want what you and Dad had.”

\n\n“You know, Carmen. I don’t give a damn what you do anymore.”

\n\nI know more about love than you’ll ever know, Sarah thought thinking of her memories of Peter Musconi, but said nothing.  What she had with Peter was beautiful, spoiled by the misunderstanding that shattered a joy of caring. It was love so special, so electric and binding between two human beings that Carmen could never know.  But Sarah could not tell Carmen now.  Carmen would dispute every word, and another argument with Carmen would only again accent Sarah’s failure as a mother.

\n\nCarmen rolled to one side to ease the pain of her standing. “I’m going to bed,” Carmen said.

\n\n“I’ll sleep here till morning,” Sarah said, moving to the love seat.

\n\n“Suit yourself,” Carmen said.

\n\nSarah could not sleep. With time, Carmen’s crack about Sarah knowing nothing about love hurt Sarah more than she would have expected. But why allow Carmen the satisfaction of irritating her at will?  Look at the facts. Carmen hadn’t developed life skills Sarah had hoped.  Oh, she loved Carmen and worried for her, but Carmen was not a superstar in anything. Of course she was pretty enough, being young helped her, and her deformity was barely noticeable.  But she was consistently cranky and insecure, smart but not brilliant, demanding but never giving.  And she had no parental respect … none. Well, Sarah reasoned, I gave so much more than most mothers.  She was definitely not responsible for Carmen’s mediocrity–that Sarah ultimately blamed on Carl. He really wanted a boy. Sarah saw the disappointment in his face after the delivery. At first, he was kind and attentive to Carmen, and loyal … even if humorless. But as Carmen got older and lost her daddy’s cute-little-girl routine, he ignored her. He spoke in platitudes and reprimands, chipping away her already thin veneer of confidence.

\n\nDawn came. Sarah sat up and put her bare feet on the floor. She would go see Peter. He was dying. She wanted to believe his package was a signal of his longing for her over these years, longing she hoped equaled her own. She wanted to know her never fading passion, although suppressed by time, marriage, and motherhood, was not just a memory of what might have happened.  She was unconcerned with pretenses now. She’d been desperately lonely for years. If  Carmen knew about Peter, saw him, saw the source of Sarah’s intensity, caring, hoping, and longing … Carmen would know why love lost had ossified Sarah’s heart, forever trapping the marrow of feeling inside. It was not Sarah’s fault. But it had dried up any caring they as a family might have had for each other in the early years.

\n\nOne of Sarah’s PhD colleagues knew a spine clinic near where Peter was hospitalized. Sarah made an appointment and insisted Carmen go. They would have three days together. Carmen resisted by reflex, but her pain had turned worse with winter and she liked the idea of warm Florida where she could get pills her internist would no longer prescribe, and take medically-related personal days off from her student duties at the hospital.

\n\nThe next day Sarah went to Carmen’s apartment and they took a cab to La Guardia. A freezing rain iced the wipers and visibility was not good.

\n\nCarmen undid her wool coat in the heat of the cab.  Sarah thought Carmen looked attractive in a cochineal red dress, the hemline above her knees to show her thin, only slightly defined legs, which gave her a little girl look. Sarah understood how a middle-aged man could be attracted to Carmen’s youthful skin and naturally blond hair.

\n\n“Who’s this friend?” Carmen asked as if this was the first time she’d thought of it. Sarah wanted to blurt the joy of her good memories about Peter. Tell her the crescendo of sharing and caring she had never forgotten.

\n\n“I knew him in school,” Sarah said. “I spent a year in his lab as a post doc.”

\n\n“Really.”

\n\n“He was a surgeon, but he was doing work in angiogenesis in a mouse model.”

\n\nCarmen gazed out the window.

\n\nSarah wanted to tell her what she and Peter had talked about–beauty, fulfillment, shared values. How the sound of his breathing in the dark aroused her.  She wanted to explain how an ardent suitor she never liked or encouraged in any way had lied to Peter to convince him she was unfaithful.

\n\n“Is your pain any better today?” she asked Carmen.

\n\n“It doesn’t change,” Carmen said without looking at her.

\n\nWhen Sarah asked her about her pathology rotation, Carmen shrugged. Sarah said little else  Their delayed flight arrived in Florida four hours late.  The motel front desk had already shut down. They rang a bell for the sleepy attendant.

\n\nAfter the visit to the specialist, Sarah took Carmen with her to the hospital. Peter’s family was not there; they rarely came, the nurse said. Sarah and Carmen looked down at Peter. His breath rattled in the opening of the tracheotomy tube in his neck.

\n\n“Peter,” Sarah said.

\n\nMonitors at the bedside gave uncoordinated beeps for vital functions.

\n\n“He’s not conscious,” Carmen said. Carmen’s authoritative medical-student speech irritated Sarah. “Let’s go,” Carmen added.

\n\n“In a minute,” Sarah said sharply. This is Peter, she wanted to say, the first man she gave herself to … with passion and warmth and caring she never experienced again. Do you think you’re strong enough to carry that with you for a lifetime, my little Carmen?  The joy of being loved?

\n\n“He’s seventy-two?” Carmen asked.

\n\nSarah held Peter’s coarse, dry-skinned hand in hers. Tears filled her eyes. Carmen turned away and went to sit on an armless chair near the door.  Carmen saw no love.  She saw sentimentality and it embarrassed her. Disgusting, really. The sentimentality.

\n\nBringing Carmen was an enormous mistake. Carmen would never understand; she could never perceive the reality across twenty-five years of time with Peter unable to communicate.

\n\nSarah remained quiet for many minutes as Carmen read a magazine. Sarah slowly became aware of Peter’s presence. Then there was tension in his hand, an attempt to communicate. One time she thought his head turned a fraction of an inch toward her. She squeezed his hand gently. She knew he squeezed back. Carmen never knew.

\n\n“Why did you break up?” Carmen asked.

\n\nIt was what Sarah had wanted. An interest in the past from Carmen. But now it seemed insincere.

\n\n“It was a fateful misunderstanding.”

\n\n“That is so male,” Carmen said with disdain.

\n\n“He was hurt.  We both were.” She felt Peter’s hand tighten again.

\n\n“His pressure is dropping,” Carmen said as she stared at a green-line monitor.

\n\nSarah thought through his closed eyelids Peter tried to look at her.

\n\n“His pulse is irregular,” Carmen said.

\n\n“Get the nurse.”

\n\n“Push the call button, Mother.”

\n\n“I don’t see it.” It’s probably on the floor. “Please go!”  Sarah no longer wanted Carmen in the room. Carmen’s crass aloofness seemed cruel. She wished again she had never brought her.

\n\n“Damn it,” Carmen said.

\n\nAs the door closed, the tension in Peter’s hand increased. She thought he might have smiled.

\n\nThe pulse monitor alarm went off. In a few seconds a nurse rushed in. Carmen had not returned. There was so much Sarah needed to explain; she felt life leaving when Peter’s body tensed ever so slightly in waves that must have been more imagined than real, like a breeze caressing a flag, then the flag drooping motionless. Sarah waited, hoping for more time with Peter, but resuscitation routines were useless.

\n\nSarah took Carmen to the airport that evening. With Peter’s death, she needed desperately to tell Carmen every detail of her love for him.  Sarah wanted to probe the loss she was suffering. How love could lapse so irreversibly into grief. But Carmen talked continually about her pain and her doctor’s appointment, allowing no time for conversation, as if she dreaded words from her mother, any words.

\n\nIn a motel room, Sarah waited alone for the funeral, lying on the bed with little sleep day or night, eating crackers and drinking sodas she collected from the vending machine down the hall. Three days later she attended the brief service at the funeral parlor. The youngest son had come to oversee arrangements.

\n\n“Who are you?” the son said.

\n\nSarah gave him a questioning look. She could see a likeness to Peter, and grief escalated.

\n\n“An old friend … years ago.”

\n\n“You dated?”

\n\n“Almost two years.”

\n\nHe looked away. He had demons he was hiding, but she could only guess what they might be. She wondered if he loved his father. She doubted he loved anyone.

\n\n“He was a wonderful man,” she said reflexively. She looked away.

\n\n“What would you know?” he said without turning.

\n\n“I knew him well,” she said testily. She looked away from the son, from the casket, out an open door to an alley.

\n\n“No one ever knew him.” He laughed without humor and walked away. He had no consolation for her; he had no grief to compare.

\n\nA minister, who did not seem to have known Peter or the family, said prayers. The son gave a short, remote, insecure eulogy to the thirteen people who attended. She could imagine Carmen reluctantly giving the same empty words for her. She left before the reception started.

\n\nWaiting to board a flight to return home, Sarah sat at gate A32 next to a gray haired woman in a print dress with wire-framed bifocal glasses and swollen feet in black low-heeled shoes. She clutched her bag on her lap.

\n\nSarah, when she closed her eyes, saw the redundant details of Peter’s dying parade before her. She needed to talk about him, about them.  In death he deserved to be known for the good man he was. Someone needed to know. To know the source of her misery.

\n\n“You don’t like flying?” Sarah said.

\n\n“Why, no, I don’t.  It’s my second time. To visit my only grandchild.”

\n\nSarah looked down.

\n\n“I flew down to see a friend who died …” Sarah began.

\n\n“She’s adopted.  My daughter-in-law has blocked tubes, or something.”

\n\n“I hadn’t seen my friend …”

\n\n“Did you come far?” the woman asked. She talked loudly as if she might be hard of hearing.

\n\n“I live in New York now. That’s why I didn’t …”

\n\n“I go to Houston.  It takes two stops.”

\n\nThe overhead announcement told standbys there were no seats available. The woman heard this and opened her purse and looked at her boarding pass. She replaced it.

\n\n“He was cremated,” Sarah said.

\n\n“That’s the way now. Isn’t it?” the woman said.  “But not for me. I want to be whole for the second coming.” The woman shook her head as if affirming cremation was a serious mistake. Then she stood pointing to a light green tote bag.  “Would you watch that?” the woman said. She headed toward the restrooms. Sarah waited until the woman returned before joining her group that was in the process of boarding.

\n\nHer aisle seat was on a two-seat row; in the window seat a tall black youth with a reversed-bill baseball cap sat with his knees angled into her space.  She slipped down into the seat. He said nothing. Peter’s open-coffin was on her mind, his lifeless look so inhuman that the passing of his life seemed even more acute.

\n\nThe plane leveled off at cruising altitude. The youth ate a banana he pulled out of his pocket, put the skin in the seat-back pocket in front of him.

\n\n“You like bananas?” Sarah asked.

\n\nHe looked at her as if to tell her to go away, and then he ignored her. He seemed intent on ignoring her.

\n\n“Not really,” he said.

\n\nSarah smiled. Surprised.

\n\n“Potassium,” he said.

\n\n“You play basketball?” she asked.

\n\nThe youth looked at her guardedly. He nodded.

\n\n“I had a friend who played basketball. He was tall. A natural when he was young.”

\n\nThe boy turned his head to stare out the window.

\n\n“He passed away four days ago.”

\n\nThe boy twisted in his seat. He waved to a passing attendant. “You got a pillow?” he called out.

\n\n“I’ll see,” the attendant said, beginning to open overhead bins.

\n\n“Are you tired from a game?” Sarah asked.

\n\nThe attendant returned with a pillow. The youth tucked it under his head turning away and closing his eyes.

\n\nSarah extracted an in-flight magazine from the seat pocket in front of her and methodically turned the pages without reading. The youth was asleep and breathing deeply when the snacks were served; in her seat pocket, Sarah saved three packets of peanuts for him to eat when he woke.

\n\nAt home, Sarah believed Peter waited to die until she arrived at his bedside. She removed the box from her closet, put it on the kitchen table, and removed items, pausing to stare at each one before she stuffed them back into the box and carried it to the trash shoot at the end of the hall. It was bulky and stuck in the opening and she had to push with her arm almost up to her shoulder into the main drop. When it fell, she felt no different. She had hoped for finality, a sense of a house burned to the ground and then moving on to a new life in a new place. But nothing changed. When she returned she checked the kitchen drawer to be sure the ring was still there.

\n\nThe next morning she was up earlier than usual to dress and leave. The night had been turbulent with indecision but before dawn she knew she must tell Carmen it was best to follow her heart.  Carmen must not suffer from recoiled love. If Carmen loves, she must love as much as she possibly can and never squelch love for fear of love fading.  Of course there will be dangers Sarah could never mention. Carmen wouldn’t listen anyway. But Carmen must know, a tethered heart is never freed, and swells with an oppressive sensitivity that becomes ever-present. Sarah would say no more, except she would sell the ring to help pay this semester’s tuition.

\n\nOutside the apartment building, as she was about to hail a cab, the homeless man who lived in the neighborhood called to her. He was wedged into the right angle where the building wall met the street.

\n\n“You got anything for today?” he said grinning, his eyes looking up.

\n\nSarah found a five-dollar bill in her purse.  “My friend died …”

\n\n“Oh, no.  Shame it is … everlasting condolences …” he said and a chunk of hardened egg yolk wiggled at the corner of his mouth, caught in his beard.  “… dying ain’t good for no one …  friend or not.”

\n\n“I hadn’t seen him for twenty-five years …”

\n\n“Lesson learned there … ”

\n\nHe looked content, like a baby about to burp. A neighbor had fed him. He waved to a woman passing, a stranger.

\n\n“Hey … you. Spare a little something for a homeless vet?” The woman ignored him.

\n\nSarah kept an eye to the street. Cabs were sparse today.

\n\n“I don’t think he ever knew …” she began hesitantly.

\n\nThe derelict wiped his mouth with his frayed sleeve. His eyes closed, his head nodded. She sat beside him on the street, her back to the wall. She wanted her words to come out now. She did not believe he really heard her tell him about Peter, about the missed opportunity of a life vibrant with love. But she spoke with intensity from the heart as if he knew every meaning. And when it was over, she slumped … her mind soothed, her emotions quieted …  before forcing herself to stand. When she hailed a taxi, he awoke.

\n\n“You have a good day, my dear,” he said raising a limp hand.

\n\nShe tucked a twenty-dollar bill into his jacket pocket as the taxi pulled up to the curb.

\n\n“Bless you,” he mumbled.

My one unbreakable rule was never pick up a hitchhiker.  And never at night.  But at the far edge of the headlights this girl showed up in the breakdown lane near mile marker 381, kind of humped over as if she didn’t even know I was bearing down on her . . . not like a hooker who’d be standing straight with her hand waving shoulder-high and her head tilted like a come-on . . . or some hidden robber’s decoy girl waving with both arms like the ship was sinking.  I slowed with no thought of stopping.  She stumbled into the slow lane and crumpled to the ground; I swerved left to keep from killing her.   I checked the mirrors, black except the yellow glow-dots of my running lights.  I pulled onto the breakdown lane, put on flashers, climbed down, and walked back to her.  I didn’t see no movement in the darkness of roadside pine forest.

\n\nA pickup truck passed on the other side of the highway but didn’t even slow, its lights flickering among the trees in the wide median.  There were no Good Samaritans.

\n\nShe was breathing hard and raspy.  I turned her over; her pale skin glowed a faint red in the taillights, increasing to a supernatural yellow hue with the pulse of a flasher.  A girl close to a woman but thin as an antenna.  Nose a little too big and lips too skimpy to ever be pretty.  I got her up in the cab on the seat half conscious and half sitting, and I closed the door quick to keep her from falling out.  We were a hundred and fifty-two miles from Memphis.  Still hadn’t seen any more vehicles, or anybody.  I geared up to seventy.  I tried to call 911 but got no signal.  Couldn’t raise anyone on the CB this far out and deep into night.  She’d curled up on the seat.  She moved with a jerk once, but then I thought she’d passed out.

\n\nI got the dispatcher at the state patrol when I was in range.  I began to give my location.  With a swipe of her hand on the toggle switch, she cut off the radio.  She was awake, and she wasn’t stupid.

\n\n“Don’t you ever touch nothing on this dashboard,” I said.  “Never.”  Her dark eyes didn’t shift when you looked at them.  “I’m calling the cops,” I said.

\n\nShe opened the door, pushing it against the wind like she was strong.  She climbed out on the step-up, one hand on the doorframe, the other holding the door open.  She’d kill herself at this speed.  I braked, but soft-braked slowly enough not to throw her off.  When I was down to fifteen, she jumped.

\n\nI stopped, ran back.  She was moaning.  Her arm and legs bled from scrapes.  Her nose was bleeding.  I wasn’t sure what to do.

\n\nShe raised herself on all fours, like a little dog, and looked up at me.  “No police,” she said.  She stood wobbling a little . . . lunged toward me and pounded my chest with her fists.  I wrapped my arms around her to make her stop and I held her for a few seconds before pushing her away at arms length.  She seemed more human up close.  “Come on.  I got some mercurochrome in the first aid kit.”  She backed away shaking her head no but I picked her up and carried her to the truck.

\n\nWe were rolling a few minutes later; she was on the seat fast asleep and breathing through her mouth, her nose all crusted with blood.  I was thinking about where I should drop her off in Memphis without getting too far off my route.

\n\nIt was the loneliest time of a trip, the hours before first light.  I missed my wife, Madeline, worst during those times.  God bless her.  She was at home in Oregon, a good woman . . . worked as a dispatcher for a trucking firm.  Parents ran a motel on the coast road near Gold Beach, now retired.  She was the only woman I ever had . . . married her right out of high school . . . and I was proud too.  I was probably the only faithful trucker on that Interstate for three hundred miles either way.  Vile women had tempted me at truck stops a couple times, both in Texas, but with a little prayer, God helped me pass them by.  Madeline and I had no kids.  She was too old now, and it weighed on her in silent times.

\n\nThe dark outside the cab–black as road tar–made me lonely and I called Madeline on my cell when I was in range.  “It’s the middle of the night, Clarence.  Where are you?” she said.

\n\n“Missing you, babe.”  She went silent with that bit of sweetness.  Talk like that meant a lot to her.

\n\n“I got this kid in the cab.”

\n\nMadeline was still waking up.  “A kid?”

\n\n“I don’t know.  Maybe seventeen.  She was passed out on the road,” I said to Madeline softly to let the kid sleep.  “She jumped out of the cab.”

\n\nI passed a pickup truck going about forty, the bed loaded with chairs, a stove, a refrigerator, a mattress, cardboard packing boxes with the lids flapping, and the trailer hitch sending sparks flying when it scrapped the highway.

\n\n“Is she hurt?” Madeline asked.

\n\nI shook the girl’s shoulder to wake her up.  I put Madeline on the hands-free speaker.

\n\n“Where are you going?” I asked the girl.  She was looking at me but said nothing.  A car passed going the other way.

\n\n“Look,” I said, “You either talk or I’m putting you out on the road and calling the State Patrol.”

\n\n“Tatyana,” she said weakly.

\n\n“Ask her where she’s from,” Madeline said over the speaker.

\n\nBut the girl had closed her eyes and gone limp, like she’d fainted.  I wasn’t sure it was real.

\n\n“She’s bleeding,” I said to Madeline.  “It’s all over the seat.”

\n\nThree blackbirds flapped into the air from a road-kill deer carcass.  I swerved.  “Gotta go,” I said to Madeline as I hung up.  I was trying to call the state patrol again when I saw a green exit sign to this town, Parkland, and a rectangular blue hospital sign attached to the bottom.

\n\nIt wasn’t no regular hospital . . . a doc-in-the-box operation.  I left the girl in the cab and pushed the door buzzer.  A muscular woman, close to six feet, two-hundred-and-fifty pounds, with a white lab coat over jeans and a tee shirt, opened the door.  “She got insurance?” she asked me.  I told her I got nothing to do with the girl.  What would I know?  She glared.  “She’s hurt,” I said and the woman signaled with her hand for me to carry the girl from the truck.  I laid the girl on a rolling exam table.

\n\n“One hundred and fifty bucks,” the woman said.  “Cash . . . we don’t take charity.”

\n\n“You the doc?” I asked.

\n\nShe started to cover the girl with a sheet.

\n\n“I’m leaving,” I said.

\n\nThe woman shrugged.  I got in my rig and called Madeline again.

\n\n“You’ve done all you can,” Madeline said.  “More than most.”

\n\nWell, that wasn’t really true.  I could of paid for her treatment.  But the doc would take care of her.  I thought she had to by law.  And they’d find out where the girl came from . . . and where she was going.

\n\nI cranked the motor.  The girl came running out the door, the woman in the lab coat running after her.  The girl fell and the woman grabbed her, dragging her kicking back into the office.  I followed, leaving the truck running with the door open.

\n\nThe woman was holding the girl down in a waiting room chair leaning on her shoulders.  The girl’s nose blood had clotted, but a scrape on her arm still oozed.  Another woman in scrubs was on the phone behind a reception desk.

\n\n“What are you doing?” I said.

\n\n“She can’t pay.  And she got no Medicaid.”

\n\n“You ain’t done nothing,” I said.

\n\n“The doc examined her,” she said.  “She’ll live.  She owes.”

\n\n“It ain’t been three minutes?”

\n\n“Pay up.  Seventy-five dollars will do it.”

\n\nFear topped out in the girl’s eyes.

\n\nI didn’t see no diplomas on the wall, or pictures of medical-school buildings with emergency vehicles out front.  And I wasn’t paying seventy-five dollars for a three-minute exam.

\n\n“Come on,” I said to the girl.

\n\nThe big woman moved to stop us; the girl kicked her and I pushed the woman so she fell to the floor on her back, struggling to get up.  I grabbed the girl’s arm and we headed out the door.

\n\nThe girl climbed into the truck on her own and we we’re moving by the time both women were standing in the door, one with a pen and paper, the other peering at us through the early morning dark.  I turned off the lights so they couldn’t see the plates.  We’d done nothing wrong, but they’d invent something if they could think of it.

\n\nWe were on the up ramp to the interstate.  The girl’s nose was swelling.  She grinned like we’d escaped together.  I gave her a high five.

\n\n“What the hell did you do?” I asked.

\n\n“I do nothing now.”

\n\n“So why you running?”

\n\n“I leave place where I work.”

\n\n“You got no home?”

\n\nShe shook her head no.

\n\n“Where you trying to get to?” I asked.

\n\n“Hollywood.”

\n\n“What for?”

\n\n“I sing good.”

\n\n“Well, just go to Memphis.  Lots of singing there.”

\n\nShe coughed, and I saw blood in her hand.

\n\nI got Madeline on the line.  “I didn’t feel good about leaving her,” I said.

\n\n“You aren’t thinking about bringing her home, are you?”

\n\n“I got a deadline.”

\n\n“Leave her at a rest stop.  Call the cops.”  The girl’s face scrunched with worry listening to Madeline.  I smiled at her.  I wasn’t going to leave her at no rest stop.  And she had no place to go.  “I’ll figure something out,” I said to Madeline and hung up . . . the girl smiled.

\n\nI drove straight through, napping only two hours near Boise.  I fed the kid from the cooler, and she slept in my bunk behind the cab.  When she woke, she told me the family she worked for didn’t treat her good.  She was an oh pear, or something.

\n\nI asked her about her family.  In Russia, she said.  Six brothers and sisters.  Mom and dad worked on a farm.

\n\n“You got a visa?” I asked.

\n\nShe threw up all over the seat.  Yellow and green with flecks of blood.

\n\n“Clean it up,” I said, handing her towel from my side door panel.  “I ain’t stopping till I get out of Idaho.”  Eighteen hours later I dropped off the trailer on time.

\n\nMadeline was not happy about me bringing home a stranger.  But she’d been waiting for me and had fixed a pizza and iced tea like she always did when I got in.  “She needs a doctor,” I said to Madeline, telling her about the blood.  Madeline was already fixing her ice cream with chocolate sauce.

\n\nWe took her to a real doctor.  Had x-rays and all.  The girl had a broke nose, was anemic from her monthlies, malnourished, and her leg scrapes were infected.  She had sinusitis and an ear infection.  I had to shell out three hundred bucks from my cash reserve account for fuel when the price of diesel went up again.

\n\nI went straight to bed when we got home.

\n\n“Tatyana says the man whose family she took care of in Alabama molested her,” Madeline said to me at breakfast in the morning.  The girl was still asleep.

\n\n“I thought it was Mississippi.  That’s where I found her.  She ought to have turned him in.”

\n\n“She said she tried.  But the guy was mayor of the town and the police wouldn’t listen.”  Madeline had found purpose.  The girl told her she had been heading west for more than a month when I found her.

\n\n“Where was her stuff then?” I asked.  “Her backpack?  Her plastic garbage bag?  It was like she’d left home twenty minutes before I saw her.”

\n\n“She doesn’t have a family in Russia except for an aunt whom she’s seen only a few times,” Madeline said.

\n\n“Not what she told me.”

\n\n“She’s sweet,” Madeline said, not willing to face up to Tatyana’s not keeping to her stories.  “We can’t neglect her.”

\n\n“We can’t neglect something don’t belong to us,” I said.

\n\n“Be kind,” Madeline said.

\n\nWell, Madeline had already taken the girl as family into her mind.  And I wasn’t being unkind, but I had a feeling that keeping the girl forever meant we was in for hard times.

\n\nWeeks passed.  When I was home, Madeline and I almost never ate together anymore.  At first the girl would go into the kitchen and paw through the pantry or move stuff in the refrigerator to see what might be on the back shelves to eat in her room.  She liked sweets and cheeses, and pizza, and seemed to have no trouble using the oven or the microwave.  Then Madeline began cooking for her, taking a tray of food into the girl’s room to sit with her when she was hungry.  When I was on trips, Madeline spent her time trying to give the girl a good American life.  She bought her magazines and comic books to help her English.  But mostly the two of them watched TV . . . sitcoms, and American Idol, in the girl’s bedroom, on our big screen TV Madeline had moved special into the girl’s room and bought me a used sixteen-inch screen to watch hockey or football in the kitchen.  Madeline quit her job and she took the girl to the mall almost every day.  They sat at tables in the food court and watched people or walked around and stared in the display windows of the jewelry stores.  And, as the girl healed up, Madeline bought her clothes that made her look pretty good.  She was a lot more woman than I thought.

\n\nI got back from a trip to Galveston after a swing north with a half load to Minneapolis.  I worried about my precious Madeline, like she was a woman who cared a lot and always seemed to be a set up for never-ending hurt.

\n\nTatyana was in her room with the TV on loud.  I sat Madeline down at our round metal-topped kitchen table.  She wouldn’t look at me except for a passing glance.

\n\n“We got to do something,” I said.  “She’s illegal . . .”

\n\n“You don’t know that!”  Madeline snapped.

\n\n“I do.  And you do.  She can’t stay here for the rest of her life.”

\n\n“She’s alone in the world.  She’s afraid.  She can’t see the future.”

\n\n“She wants to go to California.  Be a singer.”

\n\n“She wants to be a doctor.”

\n\n“And I want to be a ballerina,” I said.

\n\n“Don’t get smart.  She told me,” Madeline said with a scowl.  “She’s really a dear soul.”

\n\n“She lied about her family,” I said.

\n\n“She made a mistake.”

\n\n“Well, she goes out at night.  Don’t think that goes by me.”

\n\n“She has her friends.”

\n\n“Have you seen them?”

\n\nShe got up from the table; went to the girl’s room.  Why was she so angry?

\n\nTwo weeks later, at breakfast, before the girl would be up, Madeline sat with me at our kitchen table. . . her jaw set.  “I’ve seen the way you look at Tatti now, Clarence.  I don’t like it.”

\n\nI swallowed.  “What does that mean, Madeline?  Just what does that mean?”

\n\n“I’m going back to work.  I’ve got a starting date.  You’ll be here sometimes . . . between trips.  That worries me.”  Madeline glared.

\n\nI shook my head.  “We can’t have her alone in the house,” I shot back.  I never looked at Tatyana funny!   “I don’t trust her,” I said.  She wouldn’t tell us the truth about her past.

\n\n“I trust her more than I do you,” Madeline said.  The first time I ever remember my sweet Madeline saying anything so mean.  I couldn’t think of a comeback.  And I was hurt.

\n\nFall came; the leaves turned, and the temperature was mild on the Sunday Madeline, Tatyana, and me went to the Presbyterian Church together.  Tatyana wore a new swirl-print, blue-dress and shoes with them heels that made her legs look like she wasn’t a kid anymore.  We took a pew half-way back in church center, Tatyana between Madeline and me.  Tatyana smelled fresh and clean, a mixture of strong girly soaps and shampoo.  She slid next to Madeline to leave two to three inches between me and her but I still felt how near she was, enough to make me want to stare at her, see how attractive she’d become, and I had to think hard to be sure I kept staring straight ahead, looking toward the preacher, when my mind was full of her.  She weren’t a kid no more.  She’d slipped into being a woman.  I felt Madeline’s side-glances.

\n\nWhen the first hymn started we had only one hymnal in the wood slot on the pew in front of us.  Madeline held it cause she had sung in the choir but she held it so Tatyana and me could see.  I moved closer to Tatyana, looking to the page to see the words.  I could feel her breathing.  I was in the breeze of her singing.  Her eyes were crinkled with effort and her tone had the breathy sound of a singer in Memphis or New Orleans.  She’d been listening to “Oldies.”  Once, I touched her hair when I handed a prayer book to Madeline, hair soft and silky from combing.  It was only an instant but the memory of the touch stayed with me.

\n\nWhen we got home, Tatti went to her room, keeping away from me as much as she could.  And over the next few days, it got worse–her avoiding me, not looking at me.

\n\nThen I was on the road for a week weaving down the West coast to Tijuana, then to Dallas, and up through Arkansas to pick up I-40 and my thinking got jumbled about Tatti; I wanted to make her happy, make her stop ignoring me when I was home.  So I bought her a kitten for two dollars from a litter some farmwoman was selling at a roadside vegetable stand just off a state route near Little Rock.  Cuddly little black and white mixed-breed maybe two weeks old.

\n\nAt home, I took Tatyana to the cab.  She crawled into the back to find her present.  When she came out, her eyes glowed with pleasure.  Madeline held back near the kitchen door looking at Tatyana but not at me.

\n\nLater that evening I talked to Tatyana during a commercial break that I muted while the three of us were watching Dancing with the Stars that Madeline had on the big screen in Tatyana’s bedroom.  The three of us watching together was a first, the two of them had always watched alone while I took in football and hockey on that used sixteen-inch screen in the kitchen.  Tatti smiled once at me.  I think it was the kitty.  But it might have been the TV show.

\n\n“You still want to go to Hollywood?” I asked.

\n\n“She’s decided to stay here,” Madeline said.

\n\n“What you going to do?” I asked Tatyana.

\n\n“Be dresser of hair,” she said.

\n\n“She’s going to be a cosmetologist,” Madeline said.

\n\n“Still got to be legal.”

\n\nI leaned toward Tatyana.  “How’d you get in the states?” I asked.

\n\n“That’s not a fair question,” Madeline said.

\n\n“Nothing wrong if there is nothing to be ashamed of.”

\n\n“I lied my years I have.  Big boobs help make them believe.”  She cupped a hand under each still adolescent breast and lifted up like delivering two cinnamon buns.  She was grinning, the space between her front teeth looking kind of sweet.

\n\n“Tatti,” Madeline scolded.  She was not smiling.  In truth, I found it a little crude for an innocent Christian girl but when I looked again at Tatti her eyes were sparkling with mischief that I had never seen before, and I had to smile.  But she hadn’t answered my question about how she got into the country.

\n\nFrom that time on, Tatyana was at home in our house.  And she was kinder to me.  I helped her get a job as a waitress in truck stop a few miles away from home where they asked no questions and paid wages in cash from the till.  I dropped her off and picked her up at work when I was in town.  Her English was getting better and she talked about her mother and father in Russia.  She was an only child.  Her father was a doctor and her mother worked in a factory.  I told her what she’d told me before.  And what Madeline had said about her family.  I asked why she lied; she got flustered and wouldn’t talk to me.  In bed that night, Madeline insisted Tatti was the kindest, sweetest child she’d ever known . . . and would never lie.  Just confused.

\n\nThe next month I picked up a trailer from a transcontinental shipper for delivery and decided to go home early even though I’d arrive after ten.  I parked my cab in the yard, backing in so my headlights wouldn’t piss off the neighbors who went to bed at seven right after the evening CNN news.  The front window of our house glowed yellow behind a drawn shade; the window in the kitchen glared white from the fluorescent ceiling bulbs.  I’d never seen that many lights on this late.

\n\nI went into the house through the unlocked front door.  There was light under Tatti’s door.  I knocked.  No sound.  I opened the door to Tatyana’s bedroom.  She stood nude a few feet from me.  Her small breasts slippery with sweat, perfectly matched with nipples the faint pink of her smeared lipstick.  My heartbeat quickened.  She had filled out up top with feminine curves from Madeline’s good care, but her legs–still young and slightly knock-kneed–were bent-in like willow branches.  She made no attempt to hide her privates, fine hair the color brown of tree bark and looking soft.  I stared.  Finally she moved, her face without the slightest emotion at seeing me, and looked at herself in the cracked fragments of a shattered full-length mirror taped to the back of the bathroom door.  The door opened.

\n\nA dark-haired boy walked out of the bathroom; he put on a long-sleeved white shirt but was carrying jeans and wore flip-flops with nothing else.  His limp dick swayed slightly as he moved.  He was grinning.

\n\nI grabbed him by the back of the neck.  I had more than a hundred pounds on him and he was a foot shorter than me.

\n\n“Hey,” he said.  “Fuck off, man.”  But I moved him fast and shoved him and his clothes out the front door.  Tatyana still stood in front of the mirror pieces.  She was admiring what she saw, and smiling.

\n\n“Get dressed,” I said.  I went through the room, found everything that I thought belonged to her.  She turned to watch but held her ground.  I stuffed all her belongings into two pillowcases.  I grabbed her–still half-naked in unzipped jeans–by the arm.

\n\n“That hurt,” she whined.

\n\nI shoved her out the front door toward her stuffed pillowcases.  I didn’t see the boy.

\n\n“You mean man,” she called back to me.  She spat on the ground.

\n\n“You’re a whore,” I said.  It wasn’t just anger.  I felt betrayed.

\n\nI slammed the door locking it again, this time with the deadbolt.  A few seconds later I heard her pounding on the back door; she twisted the knob.  But I ignored her.

\n\nI sat in my TV recliner chair with the TV off for many minutes till my breathing slowed.  I called Madeline at work, but she didn’t pick up and I hung up when the phone went to voice answering.  Tatyana didn’t stop pounding.  Damn, I felt sorry for her.  Thought about her being afraid in the dark.  Still, to teach her a lesson, I waited till just after midnight before I let her in.  She brushed by me without a word and I imagined the feel of her.

\n\n“Sinner,” I said as she went back to her bedroom.


\n\nMadeline came home after midnight.

\n\n“You’re still awake?” she asked me.  “Tough gig?”

\n\nI didn’t answer.

\n\n“What’s up Clarence?  You look exhausted.”

\n\n“I kicked her out.”

\n\n“Tatyana?  Where is she?”

\n\nI shrugged nodding toward the bedroom.  “I put her and her stuff out the door.”

\n\n“My God,” Madeline said.

\n\n“She was screwing some sloppy pimply kid.”

\n\n“That’s impossible.”  Madeline went to Tatyana’s room.  I heard yelling and crying.  I stayed in my chair but couldn’t sleep.  I didn’t talk to Madeline until the next morning.

\n\n“She wasn’t screwing that kid,” Madeline said.  “She told me.”

\n\nBut Madeline couldn’t look me in the eye when she said it.  Madeline had come to love Tatyana like a daughter.  It was what she wanted in life and it blinded her to what was real in the world.

\n\nThe next day Tatti told Madeline I was a dirty old man.  That I was spying on her.  My mind was in a pigsty, or something like that.  She never wanted to see me again.  The following day, Tatti spent the night out and Madeline didn’t know where.

\n\n“She won’t live where she’s not wanted,” Madeline said to me.

\n\n“She did wrong.”

\n\n“She made a mistake.  Letting him in.  She didn’t have sex with him.”  But I knew Madeline wouldn’t believe any dirty truth about Tatyana; she couldn’t think bad about her girl.

\n\n“I thought she was better than that,” I said.

\n\n“She still doesn’t like the way you look at her.”

\n\n“That don’t make it an excuse,” I said.

\n\n“She’s afraid you might do something.”

\n\n“Aw, Maddie.”  I was angry as hell.  But later that day the memory of nude Tatyana touched my heart with a sweet longing coated with pain I couldn’t keep out . . . and I didn’t feel good about it.

\n\nNext morning I left before dawn to pick up a container in San Francisco.  It was afternoon before I got to the pier to wait my turn . . . hours where I could only think about what had happened.   I pasted a snapshot of Madeline and Tatyana I’d taken when we went to church months ago, and I cut out Madeline with a knife so I could see Tatyana standing alone.  I just wish I’d never seen her with that kid.  And I was even more ashamed at the excitement she still stirred in me.

\n\nI was home by the end of the week.  I didn’t try to talk to Madeline while I was on the trip, and she didn’t call me.  When I saw Madeline, she was passed out in my recliner, her mouth open and snorting, an almost empty bottle of Jim Beam on the floor.  I’d never known her to take a drink of alcohol.

\n\nTatyana had moved out.  I thought Madeline had finally caught her in a lie . . . but no, Tatyana said she didn’t want to stay in a house with me.  Madeline thought I’d made Tatyana leave, the way I looked at her, accusing her of sex she didn’t do.  Tatyana was afraid, Madeline said.  She’d gotten a job in a shoe store at the mall on a fake ID Madeline had paid for last month, and she was living with an immigrant family on the Southside, although I wasn’t sure Tatti wasn’t shacked up with a guy.  That’s what I said to Madeline.  She refused to talk to me and the air was so electric in the house I got a pickup job to Colorado so I could get back on the road and be alone for a while.

\n\nWhen I got back home four days later, the tension hadn’t eased.

\n\nAfter weeks of Madeline suffering and hearing her complain, I knew something had to be done, for both our sakes.

\n\nI finally cornered Tatti when she went out into the mall for a milkshake on her break.  I asked her to consider Madeline’s feelings.  Invited her to live with us until she could start her schooling for cosmetology.  Told her I would never hurt her and I told her I wanted her back home to be a part of our family.  She looked me straight in the eye and laughed.  Cruel.  I make her creepy, she said.  “You make me nauseate.”

\n\n“Come back for Madeline’s sake,” I said.  But her face took on a grimace and her voice was hard with scorn.  “Never,” she said.  “She want to be mother to me.  She never be mother.”

\n\n“She loves you like a friend,” I said.

\n\nShe shook her head in disbelief.  “She want no friend.  She like make rule to feel good.”

\n\nTatyana didn’t give a damn about Madeline!

\n\nOr me.

\n\nI left her.  It was cruel to say those things after Madeline’s kindnesses.  And the way Tatyana had treated me bugged me for days.  I couldn’t let Tatyana get away with her lies.  The next day, I reported her to authorities . . . in writing.

\n\nMadeline saw her at the mall off and on but Tatyana wouldn’t return her looks, much less talk to her.  And Madeline blew up when she discovered what I’d done.  Investigators came to the house.  Madeline blamed me.  Hated me.  I was evil.  I’d committed worse than murder.  She wanted to move out, or me to move out.  She didn’t give a damn which one and she was determined about divorce.  She soon made it final.  Without contest.  And without any willingness to remember our past good times together.  Deportation procedures against Tatyana had started.

\n\nI got some money from the house settlement and I upgraded my equipment to a top-grade Peterbilt; I have a cab with a cook-top and a sink, a bunk where I can stretch out full length, and a 30-inch screen flat screen TV with satellite hookup.  I live in my rig, now.  I still have that photo of Tatyana taped to the dash but most of the time I think of Madeline . . . like she was in the old days though.  I carry fishing gear . . . a stationary bike for exercise.  And I never broke my rule again.  Tatyana did that.  Oh, I give rides to friends of friends sometimes to save them bus fare, but never ride a stranger. No, sir.  Never again.  And how sad that is.  America ain’t the same no more.  Shit.  You can’t trust no one.  Wouldn’t mind going back to the days where you could help a stranger without getting sideswiped.

\n\nAnd I go to church a lot, in different towns mostly, to pray for forgiveness for the feelings I still carry for a Russian-girl alien who lied and sinned, and made Madeline and me so starry-eyed so as to mess with our feelings, and hooked my heart without a pinch of caring.

In college, I had been attracted to my roommate, Peter Townsend.  But after fifteen years of marriage to Amanda, my thoughts of Peter had faded, until I heard a rumor that he would interview for Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at the University where I was a professor of botany.  I called to invite him to our house for a dinner while he was in town.  I told Amanda.

\n\n“Goddamn it, Tony.  I don’t like him.”

\n\n“You could try,” I said.  There were a few minutes at my twentieth college reunion when I thought Amanda could never get enough of Peter.

\n\n“You made a move.  He turned you down,” I said.

\n\n“I’ve never ‘made a move’ on any man.”

\n\n“That’s a little disingenuous,” I said.  I was surprised at my anger.  We had so little between us.  And I truly didn’t care if she slept with every man she met, as long as she was confidential.

\n\n“Only if you grill.  We can eat outside,” Amanda said.

\n\n“Do a sit-down dinner,” I said.  Amanda was a proud cook of exacting proportions, frequently adjusted temperatures, and rigid freshness.  Peter deserved the best.

\n\nShe finally agreed and insisted we invite another faculty couple, Ester (in social science) and Henry (in molecular biology), and Amanda’s sister Madeleine, who was to balance the table as Peter’s dinner partner.  Madeleine was in library science, thirty-five years old and never married.  She was attractive but with a porcelain-figurine look to her face and a frightened-rabbit personality that I did not think was Peter’s taste.  But I said nothing to Amanda.

\n\nWe gathered together on a Thursday night.  I had insisted that Peter be presented as the honored guest, and he fit easily into the role as if he expected nothing less.  The dinner was below Amanda’s usual standards for excellence—she complained she lacked time during the week–and she glared frequently at Peter as if her failures were his fault.

\n\nEster started the dinner conversation.  “Why would you be interested in a chair here?” she said.

\n\n“Opportunity,” Peter said.

\n\n“Not to improve negotiations at home?  That’s how you medical doctors squeeze those high clinical salaries, isn’t it?”

\n\n“Peter is not that kind of faculty,” I said.

\n\n“How would you know, Tony? The department here is close to broke.  The previous chair left under a cloud of harassment accusations.”

\n\n“The department has an excellent reputation,” I said.

\n\nAmanda came in from the kitchen wearing oven mitts and carrying a hot ceramic dish filled with a bubbling parsnip puree.

\n\n“Are you considering other positions?” Amanda asked Peter.

“As they come up,” Peter said.

\n\nFor the next two courses the conversation came in spurts and we drank wine in the silences.  But just before dessert, Madeline told a story about her schnauzer falling into the bathtub, and Ester expressed concern about the poor quality of students applying for admission this year.  Even Amanda seemed warmed to chatty—at least a little–and told of her recent trip to the Bahamas with her boss, the university Chancellor, for a conference.  Henry, silent throughout with his own thoughts, finally said yes when asked if he wanted another piece of flourless chocolate cake.

\n\nAfter dinner we straggled to the living room.  I directed Peter to our most comfortable overstuffed chair.  Amanda, Madeleine and I sat in side chairs, and Ester and Henry took the sofa near the fire, seating that honored Peter at the heart of a half circle.  Two open bottles of red wine were on the coffee table, and there was a plate of marzipan that Amanda had beaten and molded into bananas, grapes and lemons.  A shaded floor lamp in the corner and the flames from the log fire gave us a low intensity but pleasing light.  We were all smiling.

\n\n“I can’t believe you’re not married,” murmured Ester to Peter, swaying on the sofa as if in a lifeboat, her cheeks flushed.  In the last hour she’d stared at Peter continuously, ignoring Henry.  Peter rarely looked at her.

\n\n“Are you gay?” Ester finally asked Peter.

\n\nPeter turned his head and stared.  “Not that I’ve yet realized,” he finally said good-naturedly.  In college, nude, he had been a dream of a man.  I remembered after a shower, water running over his defined figure, his abdominal muscles without a trace of fat.  He was still a man’s man.

\n\n“You’re attracted to men but never act?” Ester persisted.  She was a woman who clung to girlish guile as she approached middle age.

\n\n“Not at all,” said Peter

\n\n“Every man has gay thoughts,” Amanda said.

\n\nHer authoritative tone irritated me, and I glared at her to be quiet.  “Not true,” I said–I was sure Peter’s thoughts were heterosexual.  Amanda and I often disagreed in our unusual times of discussion.  For the most part, we spent our time in the house in separate rooms.  We had settled into a marriage with rare intimacy, and I had a circle of friends she didn’t ask about.

\n\n“What do you think, Peter?” Amanda asked.  “Every man has a touch of gay?”

\n\nI could tell the teasing about masculinity had begun to irritate Peter, and he was trying not to show it.

\n\n“I know the pain of love lost,” Peter said.  “I will never marry again.”

\n\n“Undoubtedly with gay thoughts,” Ester said.  Her probing had been a flirt that fell flat.  Peter seemed unaware.

\n\n“A woman trifled with my affections,” Peter said.  “I have not recovered.”

\n\n“It’s so easy to blame it on the woman,” Amanda said.

\n\n“She made mistakes,” Peter said, “but I never blamed her.”

\n\n“Oh, that is so male.  She made the mistakes!” Ester said.

\n\n“Don’t presume what you don’t know,” Peter said.

\n\n“Tell us the details.  Let us decide about love and affection,” Amanda said.

\n\n“What man knows the meaning of love?” Ester said.

\n\n“I want to hear,” Madeleine said.

\n\n Henry looked interested too.  He was the kind of guy who would fantasize himself in freeze-frame poses with Peter’s woman.

\n\n“Well, let me take a break and I’ll tell you,” Peter said.  He went up the stairs to the second floor bathroom while we huddled around the wine.

\n\n“That was rude,” Madeleine whispered to Amanda.  She could not suppress a dreamy adolescent gaze when looking at Peter.

\n\n“Grow up, Maddie,” Amanda said.  “He’s a monster.”

\n\n“I think he’s a good guy,” Henry said.

\n\n“Shut up, Henry,” Ester said.  “He’s a fucking sexist.”

\n\nHenry stared at the fingers of his right hand that he splayed for no reason.  He’d repeated the gesture frequently since we’d left the dining room.  “That’s not fair, honey.”

\n\n“You’ve got a rock for a brain,” Ester said.  She filled her wine glass.

\n\n“Look,” I said, “Peter is our guest.  It’s not fair to put him on the spot.”

\n\n“Loosen up, Tony,” Ester replied.

\n\nPeter came down the stairs and sat again near the center point of our half circle, sinking down in the soft chair.  Everyone could see he was eager to tell his tale.

\n\nHe began . . .

\n\nThe third year after I was appointed full professor in psychiatry, a medical school student, I’ll call her Cathy, came to do research.  Her project was clinical fluff, some idea that hypnosis at age regression levels could be used to pinpoint triggers of recurrent depression.  Cathy saw patients in all faculty practices, but she spent more time with me than anyone else.  Looking back on it, there was probably an unrecognized attraction from the very beginning.  I found her competent and always available, and was careful to treat her no better or worse than any other student.

She was a small girl with light brown hair, a round face with slightly pinched features, and penetrating pale blue eyes.  Her lopsided smile, more right than left– quickly became endearing–one of her best features.  She was a runner with a svelte figure and dressed in professional silk blouses and colorful skirts with provocative hemlines.

As was routine after students completed a service rotation, she was invited to the annual department outdoor barbecue.  In a social setting, I found her animated intelligence charming, and since she was technically no longer a student, I asked her for a date.  She asked about my divorce–I’d been a bachelor for fourteen years, and she thought my maturity attractive.

In a few weeks we couldn’t bear to be away from each other.  It was a mutual attraction of a lifetime.  At the end of internship, she accepted a pediatric residency in New Haven.  I, of course, could not move from my position at the University in D.C., and we vowed to spend every weekend together until she could finish her two years of training.  As it turned out, she could rarely leave her clinical responsibilities, and I traveled to her.  In the second year, our weekends together became more infrequent.  I would arrive ungreeted at the airport and take a taxi to sit alone in her cramped apartment on a bone crunching futon.  When she finally left the hospital, she was too exhausted to make love.

In two years she managed only two trips to Washington, but I did take her to New York or Boston a few times.  She began to talk of a formal wedding.  In public, she referred to us as engaged and wore a plain gold ring when we went out that disappeared by the time we settled back in our hotel room.

But in truth, there were times when I felt like a stranger.  My lifelong policy had always been honesty, and I told Cathy of the strain of traveling so far for so few unpredictable hours of watching her sleep.  And I always added–repeatedly–how much I needed her.  We can work it out, she said.

Just before we broke up, it was late autumn and the leaves were off the trees. The only flight available for the weekend made two stops and was two hours late.  It was past eleven when we got to her apartment complex.

Cathy slowed in the lot with reserved parking.  A van with dark tinted-windows crowded into her space between two smaller cars.

She parked on the street and I rolled my suitcase to the apartment and carried it up three fights of stairs.  I went to shower.  Cathy slipped into a tee shirt and shorts and turned to making her dinner.  I had eaten during a layover.

She made a sandwich for herself and was eating at the metal-topped kitchen table when I sat across from her in my underwear to have a glass of wine.  We heard a knock on the door, and Cathy put down her sandwich.

“Don’t answer it,” Cathy whispered, signaling me to be quiet.

A man’s hoarse voice called her name, and the knocking got faster and louder.

I got my pants from the closet and fumbled in my hurry to get them on.

“Go away,” Cathy called out.

The man began pounding the door.

“Cathy!” he yelled.  The pounding increased.

“He’ll go away,” she said softly.

\n\nShe seemed to be right.  Footsteps retreated down the wooden floors of the hallway.  She released her grip on my arm and I led her into the living room.  She collapsed into an overstuffed chair, her limbs shaking.

I sat on the sofa opposite to her.  My breathing began to slow.

“You know him?” I asked.

“I’ve seen him once,” she said.

I was about to ask for details when the two hooked prongs of a tire iron splintered through the upper panel of the door.  My gaze locked on hers in disbelief.

“Caaa—thy,” the attacker moaned.  Then after another blow, “I know he’s in there.”

“Go away," Cathy said. “I’ll call the police.”  But her last few words were buried in a crash of iron on wood.

Cathy turned off the floor lamp in the living room, as if a dim light might slow him down.

“Get knives,” I whispered as we backed into the kitchen.  She opened drawers and found a bread knife the length of a rat; she pointed to a small paring knife for me that would have been useless.  Cathy’s look had shifted from scared to terrified.

We retreated to the bedroom; the explosive sounds followed.  Whap, groan, whap, whap.  I wondered if the attacker had a gun.

“He’s going to kill us,” I said.

“Dear God,” she said.  I locked the bedroom door, twisting the pouty-lip dime-sized center circle in the handle.

Cathy cowered on the bed, her knifepoint straight up.  I searched in her closet for a gun, or an axe, or even a ski pole.  I came up with a metal clothes hanger and unwound the wire; maybe I could blind him.

The pounding got faster again.  Cathy dialed 911 on the bedside phone.  “We’re being attacked,” she screamed.  She had to repeat the address twice.  I wedged the back of a chair under the bedroom door handle and pulled Cathy off the bed and as far away from the door as possible.  We crouched, weapons ready.

The attacker crashed into the apartment, bumping against the living room furniture.  He started with his tire iron on the bedroom door; Cathy was wheezing.  In less than a minute, he was through the door, shoving the chair barrier aside easily with one arm.  I couldn’t see his face in the dark.

“Get in the bathroom,” I yelled to Cathy.

We clambered to the bathroom–no bigger than a hall closet.  I flipped the light switch as Cathy climbed over the toilet into the tub so I could get the door closed.  I pushed the center lock-pin in the door handle.  The attacker’s tire iron splintered the door panel and came within inches of my face.  I stumbled, knocking Cathy down.

The attacker kicked out the door panel and reached in and twisted the door handle from the inside.  When the door opened, he froze and stared first at me and then at Cathy.  He was almost six feet tall with narrow shoulders and a beginning potbelly.  He looked about thirty.  He wore glasses, a tee shirt and tan cotton pants.  His scruffy running shoes had untied laces, and he wore a wide belt that held an automatic pistol.

Cathy had one leg over the edge of the tub; he stared at her thigh.  She pointed the knife at him, twisting the shower curtain to cover herself.  I gripped the showerhead with one hand and waved my clothes hanger.

He rested the curve of his tire iron on the bathroom tiles and we had a few seconds to think.  He was now strangely subdued.

“So this is the boyfriend?” he said, looking to me as if I were some inferior cut of beef just served in an overpriced restaurant.

“Fiancé,” said Cathy.

“I should kill him,” the attacker said.  His voice was breathy and mean.

He backed into the bedroom pointing the pistol at me with his right hand and holding the tire iron with his left.  Cathy sobbed.  “Get out,” she said.  Then, this guy, whose name turned out to be Kyle, sat on the bed and wept, moaning.

I let out a giddy laugh when I realized I wouldn’t die.  Cathy walked to the bed and tried to take the gun from Kyle, who pushed her away.

Two cops arrived and asked questions to Cathy and Kyle–because of their youth–as if they were betrothed and I were the stranger.  I tried to maintain a dignity, but I was fighting humiliation at being ignored as some elderly nobody.

After ten minutes the man cop arrested Kyle taking him to the station and the woman cop stayed behind to write the formal report.  I pretended disinterest.

Cathy told her story.  She had met Kyle on a rare night off when she was lonely and went to a party for singles.  They talked for a few minutes.  “You’re everything I ever wanted in a woman,” Kyle had said.  At that point, she told him she was engaged and to leave her alone.  After the party Kyle became more determined, and he started calling her five, six times a day.  As the cop finished writing, I stared a Cathy in disbelief.  Why hadn’t she been honest enough to tell me?  The cop finally left.

The door to the apartment was useless.  Cathy found a sheet, and by using lots of thumbtacks, we covered the holes in the door.  Then I backed the sofa and tilted it on end so that it blocked most of the opening.

We got in bed and propped pillows against the headboard.  We sat in silence.

“Who really is this Kyle?” I finally asked.  She was still breathing fast.  He was a computer programmer whose hobby was making kites in the shapes of dragons, snakes and carnivorous dinosaurs.  That was all she knew.

“You dated?” I asked.

“Never,” she said.  “I didn’t lie.  He was at one party.”

Despite her denial, the thought of Kyle and Cathy as a couple overwhelmed me.  Women went to singles parties to pick up guys, right?  I sulked.

“Forget him.  I’ve wanted to see you so much,” she said.

“Look.  I’m angry.  Okay?  I mean, I come to visit my fiancée, and her boyfriend tears down the door and wants to kill me.”

“He isn’t my boyfriend.  Can’t you just hold me?” she said.

I flushed.  “I didn’t diddle with other girls.”

She began crying.

“Did you screw?” I asked.

“What a terrible thing to say,” interrupted Amanda.

“Chauvinist.  You hadn’t even committed,” Ester said.

“What did she say?” I asked.

She said: “Of course not.”  She turned away from me.  And we fell into silence.

The electric clock on the night table had an irritating drone and a click as the second hand staggered around the iridescent dial.  I kept at least eighteen inches between us.

I stayed silent, my breathing strained.  I listened to the night-sounds of the normal people living around us.  Bath water running.  A toilet flush.  A yell in the parking lot.  A car starting up.  I felt as if I didn’t belong.

At one point she touched me gently on the side of my face and I moved farther away.  At six thirty, first light slipped into the room under the window shade.  Cathy got up to make coffee.

In the daylight, the sofa propped on end against the door looked ridiculous, and the sheet we had tacked up barely covered the opening and was so transparent I could see the apartment door across the hall.

I told Cathy I would leave that afternoon.  A day early.

“I’m afraid,” she said.  “I can’t get the door fixed until Monday.”

Without a word, I went out back to a trash heap behind the complex and picked out a set of mismatched boards.  Then, using some nails I found in her utility closet and with a rock I retrieved from the edge of the parking lot, I nailed a barrier over the door, board-by-board, inch-by-inch.  She could go in and out through the window to the iron fire escape.

“Can’t you just love me?” she asked.

I had no conversation in me.  I turned away and quickly packed.  When I left for the airport by taxi, Cathy stayed in the bedroom behind the closed door.

Years later, she married a doctor.

I never saw her again.

We sat in silence for a while.  Amanda was the first to speak.

“You should have believed her.  She loved you.”

“She should have told me about Kyle,” Peter said.  “She had some deep-seated reason for not telling me.  It was a matter of trust.”

“Why don’t you look into yourself for all that deep-seated crap,” Ester said.  “You rejected her.  You ought to be jailed.”  Ester threw a closed fist into the air.

“You were a jerk,” Amanda said.

“She sacrificed so much for you,” Ester said, her voice rippling in anger.  “This Cathy.  She’s a saint.”

“I’ll agree she wasn’t evil,” said Peter.  “But she made a mistake going to that party, and she couldn’t admit to it.”

“There is nothing more precious than a woman’s love,” Madeleine said softly.

Henry looked up in disgust to where the ceiling met the wall.  Ester squeezed her lids shut to avoid looking at Madeleine whose moist eyes glinted in sympathy for Peter.

“Don’t tell us you never dated other women,” Ester said.  “All those years.”

“My only liaisons were necessities of my profession.  They were hardly dates.”

“You’re unbelievable,” Amanda said.

Peter flushed.  He stood and walked to the door.  I stood to dissuade him, but Amanda pulled me back down and shushed me.  The silence was hostile.  Peter said nothing, putting on his coat and closing the front door without looking back.

I looked around.  Everyone, except Madeline, seemed relieved he was gone.

“We should have been a little more gracious to him,” Madeleine said to Amanda.  “He has so much more depth than I imagined.”

“He’s an asshole,” Amanda said

“I thought him sensitive,” I said.

Ester put her glass on the coffee table with a thud.  “That’s what I’ve never liked about you, Tony,” she said.  “The way you treat women.”

Amanda laughed.

“Don’t turn on me,” I said.  “Peter’s a good friend.  He was right to question that girl’s feelings for him.”

“What he did to the girl was inexcusable,” Ester said.  Madeleine frowned.

“She made the choice.  He was the one always going to her.  He sacrificed.”  My voice was loud.  “No one should tolerate her deceit.”

“You’re obnoxious, Tony,” Ester said.  “I’ve always thought that.  I’m glad the wine let me say it.”

“Is that what you think?” I asked Amanda.  “I’m out of line here?”

She paused.  “You’re wrong, Tony,” she said.

I stood.  I would not be insulted in my own home.  I climbed the stairs and shut the door to my room.  I stood in the dark, listening as the guests argued for a while, then said their goodbyes.  I took off my clothes without turning on the light and left them rumpled on a chair.  I went to bed in my underwear and stared at the ceiling.

An hour later, Amanda opened the door to my room.  She sat down gingerly on the edge of my single bed near the foot and looked to the dark window.  She was quiet for many minutes.

“We’re sad, you and I,” she finally said.

“Speak for yourself,” I said.  I wondered at the sincerity of her coming to me like this.  She was very close to my leg.  There was a blanket between us, but I could feel her presence.  She laid the palm of her hand above my knee, her fingers spread slightly apart, but when I didn’t respond she took it away.  I could see only the indistinct outline of the side of her face in the dark.  I stayed quiet.

After a few more minutes, she left.  She closed the door with extended gentleness so no sound was made.

Sleep had still not come when the morning light seeped through the window under the shade.  The bed covers had slipped off.  I was still on my back, my hands on my chest with fingers interlaced, my feet touching.  I was alone.

        <item>

Anders couldn\'t get to the bank until just before it closed,
so of course the line was endless and he got stuck behind two women whose loud,
stupid conversation put him in a murderous temper.
He was never in the best of tempers anyway,
Anders - a book critic known for the weary, elegant savagery with which he dispatched almost everything he reviewed.

\n\nWith the line still doubled around the rope,
one of the tellers stuck a \"POSITION CLOSED\" sign in her window and walked to the back of the bank,
where she leaned against a desk and began to pass the time with a man shuffling papers.
The women in front of Anders broke off their conversation and watched the teller with hatred.
\"Oh, that\'s nice,\" one of them said.
She turned to Anders and added, confident of his accord,
\"One of those little human touches that keep us coming back for more.\"

\n\nAnders had conceived his own towering hatred of the teller,
but he immediately turned it on the presumptuous crybaby in front of him.
\"Damned unfair,\" he said.
\"Tragic, really.
If they\'re not chopping off the wrong leg, or bombing your ancestral village, they\'re closing their positions.\"

\n\nShe stood her ground.
\"I didn\'t say it was tragic,\" she said.
\"I just think it\'s a pretty lousy way to treat your customers.\"

\n\n\"Unforgivable,\" Anders said. \"Heaven will take note.\"

\n\nShe sucked in her cheeks but stared past him and said nothing.
Anders saw that the other woman, her friend, was looking in the same direction.
And then the tellers stopped what they were doing, and the customers slowly turned, and silence came over the bank.
Two men wearing black ski masks and blue business suits were standing to the side of the door.
One of them had a pistol pressed against the guard\'s neck.
The guard\'s eyes were closed, and his lips were moving.
The other man had a sawed-off shotgun.
\"Keep your big mouth shut!\" the man with the pistol said, though no one had spoken a word.
\"One of you tellers hits the alarm, you\'re all dead meat. Got it?\"

\n\nThe tellers nodded.

\n\n\"Oh, bravo, \" Anders said.
"Dead meat.\" He turned to the woman in front of him.
\n\n\"Great script, eh? The stern, brass-knuckled poetry of the dangerous classes.\"

She looked at him with drowning eyes.

The man with the shotgun pushed the guard to his knees.
He handed up the shotgun to his partner and yanked the guard\'s wrists up
behind his back and locked them together with a pair of handcuffs.
He toppled him onto the floor with a kick between the shoulder blades.
Then he took his shotgun back and went over to the security gate at the end of the counter.
He was short and heavy and moved with peculiar slowness, even torpor.
\"Buzz him in,\" his partner said.
The man with the shotgun opened the gate and sauntered along the line of tellers, handing each of them a Hefty bag.
When he came to the empty position he looked over at the man with the pistol, who said, \"Whose slot is that?\"

Anders watched the teller.
She put her hand to her throat and turned to the man she\'d been talking to.
He nodded. \"Mine,\" she said.

\"Then get your ugly ass in gear and fill that bag.\"

\"There you go,\" Anders said to the woman in front of him.
\"Justice is done.\"

\"Hey! Bright boy! Did I tell you talk?\"

\"No,\" Anders said.

\"Then shut your trap.\"

\"Did you hear that?\" Anders said.
\"\'Bright boy.\' Right out of \'The Killers\'.\"

\"Please be quiet,\" the woman said.

\"Hey, you deaf or what?\" The man with the pistol walked over to Anders.
He poked the weapon into Anders\' gut.
\"You think I\'m playing games?\'

\"No,\" Anders said, but the barrel tickled like a stiff finger and he had to fight back the titters.
He did this by making himself stare into the man\'s eyes, which were clearly visible behind the holes in the mask: pale blue,
and rawly red-rimmed. The man\'s left eyelid kept twitching.
He breathed out a piercing, ammoniac smell that shocked Anders more than anything that had happened,
and he was beginning to develop a sense of unease when the man prodded him again with the pistol.

\"You like me, bright boy?\" he said.
\"You want to suck my dick?\"

\"No,\" Anders said.

\"Then stop looking at me.\"

Anders fixed his gaze on the man\'s shiny wing-top shoes.

\"Not down there. Up there.\" He stuck the pistol under Anders\' chin and pushed it upward until Anders was looking at the ceiling.

Anders had never paid much attention to that part of the bank,
a pompous old building with marble floors and counters and pillars,
and gilt scrollwork over the tellers\' cages.
The domed ceiling had been decorated with mythological figures whose fleshy,
toga-draped ugliness Anders had taken in at a glance many years earlier and afterward declined to notice.
Now he had no choice but to scrutinize the painter\'s work.
It was even worse than he remembered, and all of it executed with the utmost gravity.
The artist had a few tricks up his sleeve and used them again and again - a certain rosy
blush on the underside of the clouds, a coy backward glance on the faces of the cupids and fauns.
The ceiling was crowded with various dramas, but the one that caught Anders\' eye was Zeus and Europa - portrayed,
in this rendition, as a bull ogling a cow from behind a haystack.
To make the cow sexy, the painter had canted her hips suggestively and given her long,
droopy eyelashes through which she gazed back at the bull with sultry welcome.
The bull wore a smirk and his eyebrows were arched.
If there\'d been a bubble coming out of his mouth, it would have said, \"Hubba hubba.\"

\"What\'s so funny, bright boy?\"

\"Nothing.\"

\"You think I\'m comical? You think I\'m some kind of clown?\"

\"No.\"

\"You think you can fuck with me?\"

\"No.\"

\"Fuck with me again, you\'re history. Capiche?\"

Anders burst our laughing.
He covered his mouth with both hands and said, \"I\'m sorry, I\'m sorry,\" then snorted helplessly through his fingers and said,
\" Capiche - oh, God, capiche,\" and at that the man with the pistol raised the pistol and shot Anders right in the head.

The bullet smashed Anders\' skull and ploughed through his brain and exited behind his right ear,
scattering shards of bone into the cerebral cortex, the corpus callosum,
back toward the basal ganglia, and down into the thalamus.
But before all this occurred, the first appearance of the bullet in the cerebrum set
off a crackling chain of ion transports and neurotransmissions.
Because of their peculiar origin these traced a peculiar patter,
flukishly calling to life a summer afternoon some forty years past, and long since lost to memory.
After striking the cranium the bullet was moving at 900 feet per second,
a pathetically sluggish, glacial pace compared to the synaptic lighting that flashed around it.
Once in the brain, that is, the bullet came under the mediation of brain time,
which gave Anders plenty of leisure to contemplate the scene that, in a phrase he would have abhorred, \"passed before his eyes.\"

It is worth noting what Ambers did not remember, given what he did remember.
He did not remember his first lover, Sherry, or what he had most madly loved about her,
before it came to irritate him - her unembarrassed carnality, and especially the cordial way
she had with his unit, which she called Mr. Mole, as in, \"Uh-oh, looks like Mr. Mole wants to play,\" and \"Let\'s hide Mr. Mole!\"
Anders did not remember his wife, whom he had also loved before she exhausted him with her predictability, or his daughter,
now a sullen professor of economics at Dartmouth.
He did not remember standing just outside his daughter\'s door as she
lectured her bear about his naughtiness and described the truly appalling punishments Paws would receive unless he changed his ways.
He did not remember a single line of the hundreds of poems
he had committed to memory in his youth so that he could give himself the shivers
at will - not \"Silent, upon a peak in Darien,\" or \"My God, I heard this day,\" or \"All my pretty ones? Did you say all?
0 hell-kite! All?\" None of these did he remember; not one.
Anders did not remember his dying mother saying of his father, \"I should have stabbed him in his sleep.\"

He did not remember Professor Josephs telling his class how Athenian prisoners in Sicily
had been released if they could recite Aeschylus, and then reciting Aeschylus himself, right there, in the Greek.
Anders did not remember how his eyes had burned at those sounds.
He did not remember the surprise of seeing a college classmate\'s name on the jacket of a
novel not long after they graduated, or the respect he had felt after reading the book.
He did not remember the pleasure of giving respect.

Nor did Anders remember seeing a woman leap to her death from the building opposite his own just days after his daughter was born.
He did not remember shouting, \"Lord have mercy!\" He did not remember deliberately crashing his father\'s car in to a tree,
of having his ribs kicked in by three policemcn at an anti-war rally, or waking himself up with laughter.
He did not remember when he began to regard the heap of books on his desk with boredom and dread,
or when he grew angry at writers for writing them.
He did not remember when everything began to remind him of something else.

This is what he remembered. Heat. A baseball field. Yellow grass, the whirr of insects,
himself leaning against a tree as the boys of the neighborhood gather for a pickup game.
He looks on as the others argue the relative genius of Mantle and Mays.
They have been worrying this subject all summer, and it has become tedious to Anders: an oppresssion, like the heat.

Then the last two boys arrive, Coyle and a cousin of his from Mississippi.
Anders has never met Coyle\'s cousin before and will never see him again.
He says hi with the rest but takes no further notice of him until they\'ve
chosen sides and someone asks the cousin what position he wants to play.
\"Shortstop,\" the boy says.
\"Short\'s the best position they is.\" Anders turns and looks at him.
He wants to hear Coyle\'s cousin repeat what he\'s just said, but he knows better than to ask.
The others will think he\'s being a jerk, ragging the kid for his grammar.
But that isn\'t it, not at all - it\'s that Anders is strangely roused, elated, by those final two words,
their pure unexpectedness and their music.
He takes the field in a trance, repeating them to himself.

The bullet is already in the brain; it won\'t be outrun forever, or charmed to a halt.
In the end it will do its work and leave the troubled skull behind, dragging its comet\'s tail of
memory and hope and talent and love into the marble hall of commerce.
That can\'t be helped.
But for now Anders can still make time.
Time for the shadows to lengthen on the grass, time for the tethered dog to bark at the flying ball,
time for the boy in right field to smack his sweat-blackened mitt and softly chant, They is, they is, they is.

\n\nWhen a girl is skinny, and calls you late at night, and you glance at
the calendar, and it is four days before you are scheduled to get married, and the girl you are marrying is not the skinny girl but another
girl, a girl who has already departed for the city where your wedding
is to be held, it is your job, most probably, to hang up the phone.
When you do not hang up the phone, you have not done your job.
When you invite that skinny girl to your apartment, and then you
jump into the shower so that you will be clean, taking special trouble
to wash the parts that matter, and then you mess up your hair so that
you will look as though you haven’t gone to any special trouble, then
you are doing another job entirely.

\n\nShe was a painter. Panos met her through a mutual friend. She
had a boyfriend, who was twenty-two years older than she, and when
Panos first spoke to her, he said that he thought that the age difference was an atrocity. “Like bombing Cambodia,” he said, convinced
that this was a joke that she would not understand. She surprised
him with a knowing laugh. They talked about his impending marriage, and about the week of freedom he had but doubted he’d use.
She took out a Paper-Mate blue pen and used it to write his phone
number on her hand. She wrote it strangely: not with numerals, but
with letters “O” for 1, “T” for 2, “TH” for 3, “F,” “FI,” and so on.
“So that makes your number ‘Efstooth,’” she said.

\n\n“Hey,” Panos said. “That’s my street: Efstooth Avenue.”
“For that joke I award you this pen,” she said, handing it over
ceremonially. “I’ll get it later.”
When she arrived at Panos’s apartment, “Efstooth” was still inked
on her hand, but that was not the first thing he noticed. The first
thing he noticed was that she was carrying a suitcase. It was small
enough that she held it rather than setting it down, but large enough
that it seemed to have winded her slightly on the way up to the third
floor.
“Are you moving in?” he said. “I don’t know how my wife will feel
about this.” She set the suitcase down on the floor, unzipped it, and
flipped back the top. There were white packages there, white sheets,
and when she unwrapped them they were her paintings. She spread
them out on the floor of his apartment. There were ten of them, each
one a small landscape with a single bird flying over a marsh and a
single human figure in the foreground. They were slightly different
shades, one reddish, one greenish, one dunnish, and so on, across a
muted spectrum.
Panos looked at the paintings and asked polite questions about
them that she answered smoothly. “I like to tell people that he’s
trying to capture the bird,” she said. “I always feel hilarious saying
that. But the bird’s not an unwitting victim. He sees the man. You
can be sure about that.” When he asked if they were all pictures of the
same scene, she said that she saw how he’d think so but that no, three
of them were painted from actual photographs of her father hunting
and the other seven were created from imagination. “My father left
when I was a little girl,” she said. “I remember that he yelled a lot,
and that he was mean to my mother, and that she was happier without him. But recently I have been looking for pictures of him. I found
three and made up seven more. No one should have fewer than ten
photographs of her father.”
They turned the TV on but turned the volume all the way down.
They ordered pizza. She sat in a chair across the room from him, and
announced that she hadn’t showered that morning, because the water
in her apartment was too cold. Panos told her she was welcome to
take a shower if she wanted. “We’ll see,” she said, and went around

the apartment ticking her finger across the spine of books. “Lots of
history books,” she said.
“Not mine,” Panos said.
“Oh,” she said. “Too bad. I love history books.” She was wearing
tight stretch pants and a tight white shirt. It was obvious to Panos
that she was the skinniest girl who had ever been in his apartment.
She was not wearing a bra, which put her in the company of at least
two other girls who had been in the apartment, neither of whom was
the girl who was, in four days’ time, going to be his wife. His wife
always wore a bra, and even three years into their relationship, she
gave a little involuntary gasp of pleasure whenever he unclasped it.
He figured that it was, at best, a reflex. The history books were hers.
The skinny girl came and stood right next to Panos. She planted
her feet to make it clear that she was ready to address the issue.
“Well,” Panos said. “Here we are.”
“We are here,” she said. “No doubt about that.”
“It’s all in the way you say it,” he said. “‘Here we are’ is more
loaded than ‘we are here.’”
“Is that what we are? Loaded?” she said. “Speaking of which, I’ll
have more wine.” She shook her glass and sloshed out a few drops
onto her shirt. “Shit,” she said.
“I have extra T-shirts,” Panos said.
“I’ll just take this off,” she said, and did.
“Come here,” Panos said.
She sat on the couch and pushed up alongside him. They watched
the TV, which was showing a strongman competition. A fat Swede
was jogging down a short track, the chassis of a car held on his shoulders. “I really stink,” she said. Panos closed his eyes for research. She
was right, in a way: it was the smell of young sweat, of a black flower
blooming. She unbuttoned his shirt and laid her head on his chest.
“Now you’ve got me thinking about my father,” she said.
“I do?” Panos said. “How?”
“It’s not that hard to do.”
“I don’t think I like your tone,” he said.
“I’m sure you don’t,” she said. “No one ever does.” She squeezed
his arm. “You know what my father did? Other than leave, I mean.”

“And hunt.”
“And hunt. No, I mean what he did for work. He was trained as a
lawyer but about a year before I was born he quit to work on a biography of his great-grandfather, who was a British intelligence agent who
specialized in code breaking. Do you know about the Zimmermann
Telegram?” Panos shook his head. She didn’t continue right away.
He put his hand on her stomach, and then slipped a few fingers just
inside the elastic band of her pants.
“Tell me,” Panos said.
“What?” she said after a while.
“Tell me about the telegram.”
“Oh,” she said. “Why? Are you really interested?” Panos nodded
and let one finger drift a little lower. “Of course you are,” she said.
“Really,” Panos said. “Keep telling me about it.”
“Fine,” she said. “This telegram was sent from the German foreign
secretary to the German ambassador in Mexico, and it announced
that the Germans were going to support a Mexican attack on the
southwestern United States. The British, including my great-greatgrandfather, cracked the code. When the telegram was verified,
Wilson armed ships to defend against Germany, and a few days after
that, we were at war. World War One.”
“You know, even though the history books aren’t mine, I managed
to figure that out.”
“The code was a cryptogram. We cracked it partly because one of
the top German spies, Wilhelm Wassmuss, had lost his codebook in
Iran the year before. We picked that up and it helped with the Zimmermann Telegram.”
“We?”
Now she didn’t like his tone. “We the British. We my great-great-grandfather.” The strongman competition had ended, and now the
TV was showing dirt bike racing. She got up to go to the bathroom,
and when she came back she started to pack her paintings back into
the suitcase. “What color would you say this is?” she said, holding
up a canvas.
“Blue.”
“And what about this one?”

“Also blue.”
“Right. But isn’t that ridiculous? Two colors that are so different,
but they’re considered the same. It’s almost reason enough to become
a painter, just to try to understand that. Colors are like a code, too.”
“Oh, yeah,” Panos said. “Finish the code story.”
“It was finished,” she said. “Finished enough. I was out of that and
on to color. Blame your bathroom. It’s blue.”
“I didn’t pick that color.”
“It doesn’t look like your thing,” she said. “When are you getting
married?”
“Sunday,” Panos said. “It’s strange. It seems like a million years
away, and also like it’s going to happen the first time I let myself
breathe.”
“You’re not breathing?”
“Not always well.”
“Is it because I stink?”
“It’s because I’m not sure what message I’ll be sending if I do.
Maybe my true feelings will come through.”
“What are those true feelings? I assume they have something to
do with the reason I’m here.” She had her chin tilted up now, and her
words were falling into the space between them.
“Ambivalence.”
“That’s not a feeling. It’s the presence of two feelings at once.
What are the two?”
“Joy and fear? Happiness and hatred? Rightness and wrongness?”
“Wrongness?”
“The most obvious kind of wrongness. Like maybe this isn’t the
right choice. Like there are a million people to love, and how can I
settle on one and be sure that I’m not a fool? I have met others. I
might meet others. What about Eskimos?”
“The Eskimos,” she said. “Of course.”
“Or the Finns or the Malays or all the other people I don’t even
know about. Maybe I could be with one of them without ambivalence. Don’t you have these questions about your boyfriend?”
“He’s a quick story. He’s older, is big like you, has a beard, helps
pay the rent on my painting studio, treats me with what we’ll say is

kind contempt. That often does the trick for me, as it turns out.” She
slipped a hand inside his shirt and hooked her leg over his. “Will you
kiss me?”
“Sure,” Panos said. “But I’m not sure about more. I want to, but
you know.”
“Now that’s ambivalence,” she said. After they kissed, she pulled
her pants down far enough to show him that she wasn’t wearing any
underwear. “Put your hands on my ass.”
“If you insist,” Panos said. “But I want you to know that I feel like
I could stop any time.”
“I’m flattered,” she said, her eyes narrowing.
“What I was going to say,” Panos said, “is that it’s like when a
drunk driver thinks that he’s in control of his car.”
“Oh,” she said. “Maybe I am flattered. Well, do what you want,
or don’t. Your hours are numbered anyway. I have told you so many
state secrets that I’m going to have to kill you. Anyway, it’s not too
long until morning. I’ll be gone soon.” They leaned into each other
and she pretended to concentrate on the dirt bikes on TV.
The sky outside was already starting to change color, from black
to a weaker shade of black. There wasn’t any blue in it yet. “There’s
a bird out there,” Panos said. “I rarely actually see them at night.”
“The man sees the bird,” she said. “You can be sure about that.”
She made birds with her hands and flew them up high so that her
arms were stretching as far as they would go. She was so skinny that
there was something painfully religious about that pose. It was a
pose of appeal to something far beyond him. “Put your head back
down on me,” she said, and he did. She stroked his neck, unbuttoned
his pants, made circles with her fingers on his stomach, exhibited
restraint. Taking off her clothes would have been as easy as asking.
How often are things as easy as asking?
At seven, it was time for her to go. Panos found her shirt and buttoned up his own. “Okay,” he said. “What’s the way to do this?” He
hadn’t anticipated the need for any secrecy. He had planned to sneak
her out at three in the morning or so. But now his neighbors were
up, and many of them knew his wife, and he wasn’t sure what they
would make of a strange skinny girl leaving his apartment early in
the morning.

“I’ll go down and throw out the trash,” he said. “If I buzz on the
buzzer, that means the coast is clear, so come downstairs quick. The
door will lock behind you.”
“Okay,” she said. “Can you carry my suitcase along with a trash
bag? That way I can get there fast. I won’t have to bump around on
the stairs.”
“It’s like being a spy,” Panos said.
“It’s nothing like that,” she said. “I could tell you stories.”
Did Panos take her to breakfast? Not to take her would have been
rude. But he did not pay. That would have been too conspiratorial,
and too high-handed, both at once. Besides, he was not hungry, just
intensely thirsty, enough so that he bought a half-gallon of orange
juice from the corner store and drank it straight from the carton
while he stood out on the sidewalk. She stopped in a coffee shop and
ordered a toasted bagel; a bit of melted butter ran down her chin
when she ate it. Her chin was slick with the butter. The sky was a
brilliant shade of blue. At that moment, just at that precise moment,
he wanted to invite her back up to his apartment and make all the
mistakes he had avoided making. Instead he changed the subject, for
the last time. “You forgot to get your pen back,” he said.
“You can keep it,” she said. “Remember me by it. That’s kind of
nice, right, to remember someone by something totally anonymous?
When you write with it, it’ll be like there’s an invisible ink message
just under the real message.”
“What does it say?”
“You wouldn’t understand,” she said. “It’s in Inuktitut.”
“What is that?”
“Look it up,” she said. “You have books. I’ve seen them. Okay:
I’m leaving.”
“See you,” Panos said.
“Or not,” she said. “Probably not.”
“Well,” he said, “I hope you enjoyed your time on Efstooth
Avenue.”
“You’re an idiot,” she said. When she leaned in to kiss him goodbye he smelled it again, the black flower blooming under her arm.
He went back to his apartment and pulled out history books until
he found a listing in the index for the Zimmermann Telegram. He

read a few paragraphs that he didn’t understand. They might as well
have been in Inuktitut. In the front of the book, on a flyleaf, his
wife had signed her name. His wife, almost. He shut the book hard,
like a trap. He was trying to capture his ambivalence or kill it. Three
days later, he watched his wife sign her name again, on a marriage
certificate, beneath a paragraph he understood completely. The ink
and sky were blue.

My Americanised Dublin-born friends liked to call my ever-extending work leave a “sabbatical,”
although I don’t expect most people would be spending it in Portadown if that is indeed what they were doing.
\n\nI was three weeks into said sabbatical when Nanny announced that her wedding ring was missing and had been for a while.

I spent a lot of time looking at Nanny’s hands.
Her veins were puckered like squiggling purple worms under tracing paper.
The skin was bruised, though it had been months since her last fall, and her fingers were gnarled as tree twigs with arthritis.
Indeed, now that I looked properly, I noticed her ring finger was indeed ringless,
leaving behind a white line only a hair lighter than the rest of her skin.
Gone was the stout woman who had helped raise my brother and I when Mum had died,
\n\nthough she must have been going through something equally painful, losing a child of thirty-seven years.

Each time I walked into Fields Nursing Home I hoped that woman would be sitting there instead of this skeletal figure,
\n\nwho had fat hanging awkwardly from her bones, as though it knew it should no longer be there but had nowhere to go.

I’d never been pleased about Nanny coming here, but we’d had to be realistic, my brother and me.
I never wanted anything to change,
never wanted to stop visiting her little bungalow snug in a small housing estate in Gilford with all its childhood memories
enclosed in dozens of photo frames. But it was either move her to a home or some paramedic finding her dead,
face down on the floor, trying to answer the phone, as she could never just let it ring out,
always desperate for a chat. Always hoping one of her grandchildren was calling,
\n\nthough our calls had become frequently infrequent as we grew up and started careers and moved out and on.

I asked Nanny how long the ring had been gone, a strange feeling stirring in my stomach,
like I’d been shocked with electricity.
\n\nMy eyes were suddenly wide open, ears perked, posture straightened.

“Oh, a few weeks at least, maybe a month or two,” she said, with some, but not an overwhelming amount of dismay.

\n\n“Are you sure, Nanny? Maybe it was bothering you and the nurses took it off…” I tried to reason but she was shaking her head;
she was disappointed in me.
My brother and I were my Nanny’s favourite people, in fact, I believed, the only people she could stand at all.
This knowledge tugged something inside my chest whenever she looked at me with that grim embitterment;
I’d broken an unspoken rule asking this question.
Nanny was frail and sometimes, when standing,
appeared so hunched over she might just snap but there was nothing wrong with the woman’s memory.
It wasn’t like when Grandad had been put into a fold,
as they call it here, when his Alzheimer’s had turned the gentle giant I’d known as a kid into a giant more
resembling the one from Jack and the Beanstalk. Sometimes I think Nanny wished her memory would start to sieve,
bring her back to when she’d been happy, before she’d lost her only daughter.
The last time I’d seen Grandad he’d called me Sharon, though I looked very little like my mother,
\n\nhaving too much of my father’s family in me. Surely, he was happier thinking she was still alive.

“I’ll go speak to one of the nurses, find out what’s going on,” I told her, feeling the rush of blood through
my legs after so many hours of sitting. “I’ll be right back, I promise.”
Nanny always got a frightened look in her eyes whenever I left, worried I wouldn’t come back.
Worried I’d catch a life-threatening bug and be dead in a week, just like Mum.
Or maybe she was worried she would be alone when her calling to the great beyond finally came.
\n\nI squeezed her hand on my way out.

I found myself getting a little more than frustrated with the nurses when they could tell me nothing about the ring.
The third nurse I spoke to was particularly young, probably in college, perhaps on placement,
her eyes still sparkling with dreams of the difference she hoped to make in the world.
She had glossy pink lips and a swishy ponytail and a pair of thick rimmed glasses that I recognised from the Penneys’
accessories section. She held a bottle of Coke Zero in her dainty hands and spoke to me breathlessly,
like a girl run off her feet. She made the grave mistake of suggesting Nanny was confused,
the same one I had made,
so it was perhaps a little hypocritical of me to spend the better part of ten minutes explaining to her that she absolutely wasn’t,
that she could remember what I’d been wearing yesterday enough to say this morning,
“Thank God you’re not wearing those awful red boots again,” therefore proving her memory was crystal.
The wee girl’s eyes had filled with tears and she’d scooted off to get her manager, shaken by the shrill tone my voice had taken.
I snapped the hair-tie I kept around my wrist as I waited,
and resisted the urge to take out my phone, reluctant to find any missed calls, as I almost surely would.
\n\nI hadn’t called back my boss, and Linda the secretary had left two voicemails yesterday.

Speaking to the manager proved to be much more controlled, but she couldn’t help either – these things just happen,
she said with a touch of sympathy but not enough that accepted blame.
She looked at me curiously, probably wondering where I’d been for the first two years Nanny had been at Fields.
Probably thinking what gave me the right to chastise her staff.
It was as well for her she didn’t ask, and I returned to Nanny’s room, empty-handed and defeated.
I felt my eyes begin to pull close again even though the jittery feeling in my tummy hadn’t
subsided as we went back to our routine of watching The Chaseand sitting in not entirely comfortable silence,
\n\n only broken by the odd quip at what I was wearing.

\n\nToday, it was about the earrings, that apparently looked like frayed knotted string.


I had started wearing earrings again, after the break-up.
Not that I hadn’t worn earrings because of him – I’m sure we never had a conversation about it.
I guess at some point I’d grown out of wearing my green-skin inducing costume jewellery and decided
only to wear jewellery with sentimental value.
I had an array of gifts from him, necklaces for my birthday or Christmas, bracelets for our anniversary,
that one special ring in the velvet black box; nine years-worth of rose, gold and silver.
I didn’t feel the need to wear anything else.
I never received earrings from him, so maybe that was a subtle indication that he didn’t like them.
Whatever the reason, it occurred to me that I had stopped wearing them and five months into the split,
I started pushing the tiny metal swords into my earlobes once more; a range of large hoops,
\n\nor miniscule pearls, or sapphire birthstones, for September because my actual birthstone was an ugly brownish colour.

I couldn’t say it gave me a pep in my step, or made me feel any less desolate,
but there was something that changed by the weight of the earrings,
\n\nor the texture as they brushed against my neck when I walked around the office – perhaps they were reminding me I was still alive.


I loved my Nanny, but old people generally frightened me. Those longing puppy-dog eyes that didn’t even know what they were wishing for.
Death, companionship… maybe just another bowl of custard.
It was now six weeks into my “sabbatical” and I was sitting with Nanny as she had her dinner – had to hand it to the staff,
it always looked scrumptious, better than the £4.99 microwave meals I picked up in the Stop &amp; Shop on the way home from Fields.
I’d sit at Nanny’s table, where I used to sit as a child, eating moist fillet steaks and boiled potatoes and carrots and swede,
all covered in molten gravy, and instead dig into a lasagne or Shepherd’s Pie, that became liquified in the microwave,
the mince charred, burnt to the plastic tray. Nanny’s house, which had once felt like the closest I could get to home,
\n\nwas now a place that looked like it should be familiar but wasn’t, like the set of a movie about my life that didn’t quite ring true.

The nurse came in at around two o’clock.
She scolded Nanny; she’d eaten just the meat and a scrape off the mound of mash which I’d been salivating over even as
I took forkful after forkful and presented it to my grandmother’s lips.
Nanny hated this part and I knew part of her hated me for not only bearing witness to her humiliation but for
being the hand that replaced her own. The nurse cleared the tray and then told me discreetly,
but routinely, it was time to change Nanny’s colostomy bag.
I knew this was my cue to leave – it was one thing to help my Nanny feed herself,
\n\nit was quite another to be present while her faeces were being discarded.

Later that day I took Nanny in a wheelchair – her walking wasn’t so good – around to the sunroom.
There weren’t many things she liked anymore but she did enjoy having the sun coat her face;
it always lulled her into a contented sleep.
She would nap for several hours, leaving me to sit awkwardly beside her,
amongst the other residents – sitting on a pin for an hour would’ve been more comfortable.
I checked my phone, maybe I’d play a bit of Solitaire, but there was an incoming call from work,
not the first of the day, and it wouldn’t be the last, so I elected to switch it off instead.
I had, for the past four days, sat at my laptop after visiting Nanny,
trying to write an article on polyamorous relationships with little to no research,
and only written less than two hundred words before giving up.
Linda hadn’t even asked about my progress on the article last time I was on the phone to her,
just when I was coming home. I went to snap the hair-tie around my wrist, but I didn’t have one on today.
I pinched my skin between my thumb and forefinger instead, but it didn’t provide the same release.
I was only wearing plain diamanté studs today, to avoid Nanny’s ruthless comments, and I fiddled with the clasp,
\n\npushing it back and forth onto my ear.

Most of the residents were asleep, mouths noisy as the nozzle of a hoover.
One was wearing a ring, I could just about see, on her wedding finger – it looked rather new and shiny against
the dull patchwork of the woman’s quilt. I always looked at people’s ring fingers,
it was a nosy habit I wished to break but hadn’t managed to yet.
I wasn’t so much interested in the ring’s appearance, just in the person, their attachments, or potential attachments.
In my experience rings on fingers didn’t have any effect on how they acted.
There was another woman, possibly in her late seventies,
\n\nbeing enfolded in bear-hugs by several family members, with Australian accents, all come to see their daft Great-Aunt.

I decided to wander off for a wee, though I hated using the toilet facilities, with the many pieces of white,
plastic helping equipment for those who struggled to sit on the seat,
those who were lucky enough to still be somewhat in control of their bowels.
\n\nI always worried I wouldn’t be fast enough and what would one of the ladies do if they arrived at the toilet and it was occupied.

A woman, a resident, was coming out of the toilets as I reached them – her posture wasn’t good but not as bad as most of the women in here.
\n\nA smell of smoggy potpourri accompanied her.

“Oh, there you are, would you mind helping me back to my room Claire?” The woman clearly hadn’t considered
I needed the bathroom or that I wasn’t Claire.
\n\nI was struck immediately by the length of her hair, which was a steel grey and plaited right down to her waist.

I dug my nails, over-grown and in need of filing,
into my palms as I tried to figure out how to get out of this situation but upon realising there wasn’t another option,
I put out my arm for her and together we hobbled into her room where the white board stated she was Myra Gleeson.
I felt the instant regret of this decision,
\n\nlike harsh indigestion, and then reprimanded myself for not being more compassionate.

Myra spoke as though she knew me well and I wondered what kind of dementia had come for her.
As I sat her down into an armchair identical to Nanny’s, I noticed on her finger, a silver ring with a pale diamond,
encrusted at the edges with little sparkling stones – Nanny’s ring.
I had almost forgotten, or perhaps tried to forget about the missing ring;
\n\nit fit Myra’s finger quite handsomely – the last time I’d noticed Nanny wearing it, it had orbited hers.

“That’s a nice ring,” I began delicately as I positioned myself not too comfortably on the edge of the vacant bed,
which let out a creaking of springs that made me wince – Myra either hadn’t heard or didn’t care,
\n\nalready used to the sound.

Her smile deepened and peeled back to reveal yellowish teeth that were all still intact,
\n\neven the ones in the very back of her whitish gums.

\n\n“Oh yes, it is, isn’t it? Funny, I get a bit of a surprise every time I see it, though I’ve been wearing it for forty odd years.”

“Forty years?” I hoped at first that I was wrong about the ring, maybe it was only similar.
\n\nThe skin on my palms was burning a little. “Would you mind if I looked at it for a moment?”

The old lady yanked it off – she seemed to have the opposite problem to Nanny – brain like mush but the strength of an ox.
I noticed as she handed it to me that there was no discolouration on her ring finger,
\n\nno pale band of sheltered skin as there was on Nanny’s.

“It’s funny, dear. I sometimes have these dreams – well not even dreams but horrible nightmares.
About my marriage, my marriage to Larry, you know Larry,” the old woman told me as I turned the ring over in my hands,
becoming increasingly certain that this ring did not belong to Myra.
“I dream of these terrible arguments, and Larry saying these awful things,
and eventually he grabs his suitcase and goes right out the door, without ever looking back.
I dream that he’s left me for someone else and I cry and cry and cry – sometimes I even wake up crying.
It can’t be true, say it isn’t true, I’m sometimes even talking out loud, the nurses say.
And yet, I wake up and there’s the ring, my ring, as though it was moulded for me,
\n\nand I wonder about this old noggin of mine – it’s not quite what it used to be. It’s playing tricks.”

\n\n“And where is Larry now?” I asked, voice thick, heart pounding so loudly in my ears I wondered how she couldn’t hear it too.

Myra’s face crumpled a little, her eyes shifted from side to side.
Her lips quivered for a solid minute, opening and closing,
desperate for an answer that might’ve been on the edge of her tongue, but wasn’t.
She didn’t know. She didn’t know where Larry was now.
“I suppose he’ll be around to visit… any minute… now… Marriage truly is wonderful Claire.
\n\nTell me, I forget so much these days, are you married yourself, nice young lady like you, you ought to be.”


I started taking the ring off a few months before it happened – I thought it was annoying to type with,
it clanged against the endless mugs of coffee I’d consume as I wrote up a new column,
the diamond often turning around and cutting the inside of my palm.
\n\nI started removing it at work, told myself when I got the time I would buy a chain to go with it and wear it around my neck instead.

\n\n“Where’s your ring?” he’d asked, one Saturday morning over breakfast, eyes peeking belligerently over the newspaper.

“Must’ve left it at the office – you know how it bothers me when I’m writing,”
I replied calmly, nonchalantly even and I’m unsure if this is what made the situation
worse or the fact that one of my mother’s silver rings was permanently attached to my middle finger on my right hand,
\n\ntyping or not – he replied with a hmmmphh noise and we said no more to each other while we sipped our coffee and ate our marmalade toast.

When I gave the ring back, it didn’t shock him, it couldn’t have,
but still he erupted. Only a couple of days later his mother,
\n\na fiercely opinionated psychologist I had only ever pretended to like, left a voicemail on my phone.

“You’re damaged goods Sam.
You don’t know what’s good for you and I don’t think you ever will.
You’re just so heartless, the way you’ve treated my son.
I always knew you were just cold, through and through.
You know children who lose their parents at a young age are more likely to have marriages end in divorce – well good for you,
\n\nyou couldn’t even make it down the aisle. Saved everyone a lot of hassle and money.”

A few weeks after he’d moved out, I found the Argento chain he’d bought me,
still in the little red box, untouched.
I’d left the ring at the office again and by the time I’d worn it home,
\n\nI’d forgotten to put the ring onto the chain… or maybe I just knew I needn’t bother.

The chain was still in my apartment in Dublin, still in its unwrapped bag,
the silky white ribbon discarded someplace. It sat at the very back of my bedside locker, mostly out of sight,
but it would peek out occasionally, reminding me.
Over my fish pie in Nanny’s that night,
I thought about a friend of mine, who’s birthday was coming up.
\n\n\Maybe she would like it – she always complained she never got jewellery.


\n\nNanny wasn’t where I’d left her that night, after I’d been with Myra; she was back in her room.

“Where’ve you been?” It was nearly five o’clock by this stage, she rarely made it past seven.
We would watch Home and Awayon RTE2 and she would be asleep before the credits rolled.
Soon her tea would be arriving and I’d have to stop myself from asking for some of her
sausages and beans even though she’d never finish them.
\n\nI had a fish pie waiting in the freezer which never seemed to heat entirely no matter how long I left it in the oven for.

\n\n“Oh, just wandering,” I said, “wondered if maybe your ring would be around somewhere.”

“And why would you do that? It’s long gone I’m sure,
\n\nsomeone thieved it, probably one of the young ones,” Nanny snorted.

“Just didn’t think it was right for you not to have it, is all.
\n\nMust hold some nice memories for you.”

“And why?” Nanny asked, suddenly more serious, although not stern.
“I have it all up here, don’t I?” she said, tapping her temple with slow deliberation.
\n\n“Finding that ring wouldn’t do any good now. And sure, you were gone for hours and you didn’t find it, did you?”

“No, no I didn’t,” the words tumbled out of my mouth before I could stop them and to my surprise,
Nanny didn’t even appear disappointed by my answer. She just nodded, triumphant that she’d been right,
\n\nand asked me to pull her bib on.

After Home and Away, and Nanny had eaten exactly five baked beans,
\n\nhalf a sausage and all her strawberry ice-cream, I kissed her on the forehead and left for the night.

I walked past Myra’s door, but the old woman was asleep, her lights turned out already.
Her hands were folded on her lap, the ring gleaming.
On her cheeks there were tears gleaming too and her face was contorted as though she was having one of those bad nightmares.
I was ashamed that I had considered taking the ring,
if she’d happened to leave it off her finger, and returning it to Nanny,
where it belonged. If she said anything the woman wouldn’t be believed; they would probably just up her meds.
But seeing Myra like that changed my mind,
and I could feel the anxiety begin to leak out of me, slowly,
like a burst pen haemorrhaging ink. I drove home from Fields that night,
and phoned my editor directly, leaving a message to update her on my progress with the article,
and giving an estimation of when I would be home.
I pulled the elastic band I always kept in my car onto my wrist and snapped it a few times to get me through the call,
but I was feeling okay. I was rest-assured that Myra at least would wake up and see the ring and be happy,
even though her memories had twisted in her mind, a jig-saw puzzle that she was incapable of filling in.
I snapped the band one more time before going inside to my gloopy fish-pie, but it didn’t provide the same relief,
\n\nbecause there was nothing there to relieve.

        <item>
\n\nI’ve been thinking about my stomach. The flat plane of my skin moving toward my belly button, the small rise below it, that piece of flesh that never seems to flatten, like tectonic plates colliding over eons of time. I’ve been thinking about seams cutting into my skin and red lines that appear when I take off my pants, so I can see pants on me even when I’m not wearing them. I put them back into my closet in case I try them on in a few months and they aren’t tight anymore.

\n\nI left a relationship because it was too tight. But once I was out, I wanted back in. It had been uncomfortable, but I made it work.

\n\nAfter washing my jeans, I have to work to put them on. I slide the jeans to the middle of my thighs. I wriggle, tugging the fabric at my calves, my knees, my thighs, easing it over the hump of my butt. I kick each leg out, trying to pull the fabric to where it is supposed to sit on my waist. Then I squat down to stretch the fabric to a level I deem comfortable. It’s been happening more often, and I find myself looking in the mirror. Is my body growing. Are my pants shrinking.

\n\n“Why would we leave something good just to see what else is out there?” we’d ask each other. We had said what we had was worth the trouble, that the good was good enough. We liked knowing what we had more than we wanted something better for ourselves. It was love, but it was also fear, visible only to me after I had left the too-tight place I had shoved myself into. Visible like contour lines on a map. Visible like red lines in skin.

\n\n I tell myself I will be more satisfied accepting that piece of flesh below my belly button, but also satisfied making it go away. These are my favorite jeans. My mother told me two years into the relationship, “You know, you might not find anyone better.” She didn’t mean I was unworthy of something better, but that he was a good guy and we worked. But I outgrew him.

\n\nDressing rooms are a dreaded place. The lighting casts shadows on my skin, throwing into relief land previously undiscovered. The mirrors cannot be avoided. I’ve always feared trying clothes on. As a young girl, my mother would not always make me try a piece of clothing on, and I would tell her I liked it, but after she bought it, I would only wear it a few times. After that, she began making me try on every single item of clothing I wanted. I quit wanting new clothes. Mine were sufficient.

\n\n“I think you two are very compatible,” a woman who knew us both said. “I think there is potential for it to work out.” By this she meant stay together long-term and possibly get married. He and I had been together for a year and a few months then.

\n\nTectonic plates move over time. Topography changes. Contour lines are redrawn.

\n\nMy jeans did not fit, so I gave them away. I want them back despite that, because I know them, and they follow my curves like winding roads on mountains. I want them back because they are familiar and worn in with my scent, even after I wash them. I want them back even though they do not fit, because having them was easier than trying to find a new pair of pants that fits like those did when they fit me, when I was smaller, when we were happier, when I was not expanding beyond the space I had allotted for myself, when buying a pair of pants seemed easier, when I was not so scared to see that I was filling myself, when the jeans slid on with ease and I wore them comfortably and felt like myself in them. I want them back.

\n\nThe lights in the dressing room are harsh, and I am alone in there, staring back at myself at all angles, me and me and me and me and wondering if anything will fit me now.

        <item>


\n\nThe city at night sounded like his ribs when they broke, his body as it caved in on itself and snapped in half so loudly they heard it downstairs and thought it was a gunshot, another bullet hitting its mark, eating into the flesh of another broken soul, unwanted — unwanted, yes, disowned, in a room no warmer than the frigid air outside, shivering under layers, skin stretched too tight across bones. He was alone, alone, never heard the knock on the door, once, twice, open, breathing in and out and choking on stale air, on the venom in the back of his throat, hunched over on the floor. He didn’t know he was crying until the tears froze on his cheeks and someone knelt in front of him, gentle hands making everything feel red hot, making the apartment swim in maroon and burnt orange and the voice spoke.

\n\nThis is where you’ve been hiding. But he hadn’t been hiding, not really, just hadn’t been found. Why had he run? He missed the safety of theirs, everything theirs, their apartment where he’d always been protected. Foolish boy, shaking violently, breaking down on a dirty floor. He’d left everything he had out of fear and suddenly he was staring death in the face, the cold unforgiving gaze of the absence of life holding his frozen hands. There were hands on his cheeks, his face, warmth radiating into his bones, melting his fear into resolve, stay, stay, stay, come back with me, I’ll help you move back in, it’ll be okay, okay, okay. Over and over, the litany he knew by heart. He apologized but his voice didn’t belong to him, not then, not breaking in the cold, shattering like the windows and the gunshots and the crumbling buildings; he knew the graffiti by heart, he’d put it there.

\n\nStumbling, half falling, never looking straight ahead, following touches on his back and whispered directions. I’m sorry, c’mon baby, I looked for you everywhere and couldn’t find you, what were you thinking? He had no answer, nothing left to give to the arm around his shoulders, no one is going to hurt you, promises while they walked, stumbling. He didn’t know how many times he had fallen but his nose was bloody, blood freezing to his face, running hot rivers down his neck, hands reaching up to wipe it away, let it fall again, wipe it away. They took the elevator; he couldn’t bend his legs enough to take more stairs. Consistency fumbled next to him, hasty fingers desperately pressing key into lock, everything familiar, clean, could feel the heat soaking into his skin, hot and dry. He thought of that desert in Arizona. They’d hiked for days just to say they had and he had pictures to prove it, hanging on the wall, their wall, with no gunshots in plaster that no fists had broken through, their bed more than just a pile of blankets on the floor.

\n\nHe went to the bathroom, their bathroom, looked into the mirror and didn’t recognize himself, fell heavy against the sink and hit his head. One bottle of whisky and ten stitches later the mirror was broken and his fist was bleeding. No yelling, not here, just sadness, disappointment, the silent growing Arizona canyon. Why did you bring me back? They lay on the floor, couldn’t sleep in their too-soft bed, he sank too far in and it reminded him of drowning, gasping for air among smoke and ash and burning things he remembered too well, fervently checking his hands to make sure they were still there. They slept on the floor, laying next to each other. Breathe in, breathe out, listen to the clock on the wall, throw the clock on the floor, shatter its face, shatter his face with it, broken pieces in the living room. He only sighed and swept up the glass.

\n\nNot a disappointment, stop saying that, stop talking like that, you’re here now, do not think about that, we’ll get your stuff tomorrow. What stuff? He didn’t exist, he was free, no ties to anything except that damn apartment, wanted the gunshots and the alleys back, taking walks among the trash cans and talking to the burnt out street lights, I know what it’s like to be burnt out. They never talked back, don’t talk back, but he had never learned not to talk back, never learned how to be broken, just knew it. The way it burned in the bottom of his stomach like the oil drum fires in the parks under the bridges, bridges like he’d thrown himself over once, same hands pulling him out. What are you doing, come back with me, don’t talk like that, different circumstances, the same words.

\n\nHe felt the water’s cold again, ice prickling under his skin, burning beneath his eyes. He saw the river behind his eyelids, saw the needle lodged in his forearm, tried to pull it out and the hands kept him still, too still, hated the everlasting stillness, the quietness. There were no gunshots here, no distant sirens, the clock broken on the floor no longer ticked, the neighbours slept and no one walked up the stairs, sat on the stoop, crouched in the corners of the steps and smoked things that smelled too sweet, hid in rooms that smelled like sweat, cold sweat, buried in as many blankets as they could find, full of more holes than the windows, always the windows. No one else knew what the windows sounded like when they shattered, with fists and bullets and barstools. He always got kicked out of the bars for drinking too much, but wasn’t that the point?

\n\nThings made less sense there, he cared less there, started too many fights. Now he started fights and there were apologies, too many, hitting him in the face, leaving bruises, worse than punches, worse than cold cracking at his skin. He liked the cold, the sharp chill of his bare back against the pavement. What are you doing, get up, you can’t lay on the road you fucking idiot. It was one time, he was just tired. They locked him up for three days, stupid junkie, didn’t believe him when he said that the sky was on fire, laughed when he told them that the oceans were drying up. There are no oceans here, have you ever seen water in your life? Too much water, walking dripping wet down the street, shifting eyes, suspicious eyes, everyone always looking down, and maybe they were scared of the fire in the sky but he wasn’t. He was never scared of anything except the bed sheets rustling next to him, next to a perfect person, scared of perfect people, scared of ruining good things and not knowing why the darkness was burning, why cold could burn.

\n\nLet me take care of you. He was always needing taken care of, wondering when he could take care of himself, knowing why, knowing that four blocks out the front door and down the street was that bridge. He said was trying to fly, knew he couldn’t fly, couldn’t bear to hear you need to sober up one more time. He was sober, sober, sober now, sober when he did it, always sober. The front doors were all the same color, lined up in a row down that street, making him sick to his stomach with the blur passing his half-closed eyelids, making him dizzy with the effort, with the bathroom tile cold, 4 a.m., tired angry voice. You gotta get better, baby I love you but you gotta stop this. He was puking up whatever was in that god damn needle, still seeing people breaking through his thoughts, clawing at his eyes, red streaks down his arms, blood under his nails, baby stop this. He didn’t want to stop, didn’t want the sky to stop burning, wanted to watch it crash and break and shatter onto the streets, burn everything too perfect.

\n\n “This type of thing doesn’t just happen overnight,” the man in the white coat told him as he shined a blinding light into his cornea, but Mirko was quite certain that’s exactly what had happened. Marija squirmed in the corner of the ophthalmologist’s office. “Probably hereditary,” the doctor told him as he ushered Mirko and his daughter out the door, “but who can really say.”

\n\nAt first he had thought it was a speck of soil on the iceberg, a mere stain of earth defiling the cool head of green, but then it showed up again on the limbs of the butter leaf, and again, hidden in the wrinkles of the darkened kale bunches. The frisée, the cress, and the endives, Mirko soon realized, had it too.

\n\nOn the walk home, he stole glances at his daughter. His attention always came back to her nose, to the profile she had stolen from her mother, and to the small black patch that now obscured it. It was not a speck of soil, and two months, as the doctor had estimated, was not a lot of time.

\n\nThe pair came to the town’s only intersection, and Mirko asked his daughter which way would lead them home. When Marija’s frustration presented itself in her furrowed brow after she suggested a wrong turn, he assured her, “It’s okay, my goose.” It was a name Mirko also called his wife, given to her after she told him the first thing she would buy if she won the lottery was a nose job. Marija, being only six years old, took no offense at the nickname. Mirko pointed his daughter in the right direction, letting her lead the way. “You’ll learn.”

.  .  .

\n\nMirko didn’t have an air conditioner that sticky July morning. His wife had taken it. She had also taken the curtains, the floor lamps, and most of the unit’s borrowed furniture.

\n\nWith no AC in the modest one-bedroom apartment, Mirko left the windows shut with scratchy wool blankets thrown over them in hopes of keeping out the heat. Because of this, the place was beginning to acquire a stale damp taste—the humidity dense enough that you might as well swim through it. A swampland, as his bride had once put it before the couple had purchased the now absent AC on a maxed-out credit card.

\n\nThat morning in the barren apartment, Mirko let the sink water go until it ran clear. It had just lost its final traces of rust when Marija wandered from the yard into the kitchen that did not smell like eggs or bacon or grease sizzling. As she itched the golden bird’s nest that rested atop her head, she looked around at the blankets that hung from the windows. The expression on her face hadn’t changed since she was born—like a doe, it was a wonder Mirko hadn’t taken to calling her Bambi.

\n\nAfter fourteen hours of labor, two failed epidurals, and an episiotomy, Marija had at last crowned. When she was finally delivered, her mother was too tired to hold the infant, refusing to take the bloody mucus-slathered child from the nurse. Mirko stepped in and held Marija to his powder blue scrub-covered chest while doctors pressed down on the mother’s stomach to force out the afterbirth. She has your eyes, Mirko told his wife delightedly. And your nose. He wasn’t sure if she heard him, as she was instead screaming at the nurses who continued to pump her abdomen until what looked like a rotted head of red cabbage was expelled between her legs.

\n\nMarija clapped her small pale hands and turned her attention to her father.

\n\n“What will we do with all this space?” he asked her.

\n\nHer eyes lit up, dark pits surrounded by almonds. “Let’s ask mama,” she whispered back, her voice stolen by the thrill of it all. She jumped down from her seat at the table, but before she could make it so far as her parents’ bedroom door, Mirko spoke again.

\n\n“Mama is on a vacation.”

\n\nMarija carried on, turning the doorknob. Mirko’s bed was missing too, as well as the nightstands and the dresser. The child turned around and looked at him.

\n\n“It’s okay, my goose. She will come back.”

\n\nMirko and Marija talked a while of making a fort in the apartment’s emptiness, and then of perhaps creating a puppet theater, but in the end, they did nothing. Instead, at noon they walked a half-mile to a farm’s entrance, where Mirko started his days driving a produce truck from one end of Cherryville, Maine, to the other, delivering small batches of lettuce between the town’s only farm and the local grocery marts.

\n\nPast infinite rows of romaine, chard, and collards bursting from the muddy soil, the father showed his daughter where the delivery truck always sat waiting for him, already loaded, the keys hanging from the ignition. He lifted Marija into the raised passenger seat where she could barely see over the dash. The first stop was Smedburg’s on Route 62.

\n\nThe two settled themselves into the cab of the produce truck. Mirko sat at the wheel while his daughter gazed out the rolled-down window. The back roads would become nearly impossible to drive during the winter, the snow, rain, and sleet tearing them up until they looked like umber rivers with all their bumps and divots and curves. For now, though, the summer heat kept them dusty and taut. Mirko admired his daughter as she took in the sights of the passing landscape, the deep dense lines of maples, oaks, and spruces. The touch of breeze cooled her chaste skin; the flush left her cheeks.

\n\nAs they drove along the road, Mirko saw it. Underneath the flapping of a used furniture tent were the couch and the flimsy mattress, the matching nightstands, and the water-stained coffee table. This is where his wife had taken all the furniture, presumably for some fast cash before her getaway. His entire living room set sat on a patch of uneven grass bordered by high-growing weeds. The set looked strangely serene, acting like it belonged there. Like it had always been outside, and the idea of bringing it into a home was the actual absurdity. Mirko thought about this for the rest of the drive.



\n\n\nMirko began taking Marija with him daily, to Smedburg’s, to Pear’s, to Harvest Fresh, to all twelve of the markets to which he was responsible for delivering fresh lettuce. He called her his co-pilot, and he quizzed her meticulously on all the routes, which she did learn with time and repetition. As the doctor had speculated, during these two months Mirko’s small speck of dirt began to grow into a thick mud that filled both eyes. A galaxy with no stars, and most certainly, no sun.

\n\nAt home Mirko begged Marija to sit with him every day on the stale blue couch which he had bought back for half-price after it went unsold in the furniture tent for two weeks. Perhaps he could have afforded a nicer one from the used selection. He had seen a leather one that looked pretty new, except for a few scratches that a house pet may have made. But in the end, he decided on the blue couch that had already once belonged to him. He had put it into the truck’s bed on the way home from deliveries one evening. In the apartment, it felt out of place in the otherwise empty living room (the only other piece of furniture Mirko had bought back was his mattress). It looked sad to Mirko, from what he could make out of it. Marija had said to him once how lonely it seemed, to which Mirko replied that they must keep it company when they could. It was on this couch where Mirko would spend hours studying his daughter’s small, soft face.

\n\n“Does it hurt?” she’d asked him as he stroked his thumb down the bridge of her nose. Beginning at the pupil and spreading over his iris was a milky white that looked less like cream and more like curdle.

\n\n“No, my goose. It does not hurt.” Mirko traced the cheeks of his daughter.

\n\n“Does it make you sad?”

\n\n“The only thing that makes me sad is the fact that I will soon not be able to see my goose.” Mirko brushed his index finger over his daughter’s lips. Marija stood up and retreated.

\n\nHe listened to her steps. He heard her pull a stool up to the gas stovetop and flick on the burner. From the sound of the sizzling butter, he knew that she was making them grilled cheese sandwiches. This was one of the three things she knew how to make, the other two being canned soup and scrambled eggs. He listened as she slid the plastic spatula between the bread and the cast-iron skillet. When she gave a cry, he told her to run it under the cool water. She kept the water running for a long time, until at last Mirko told her to turn off the stove when he smelled the butter burning. “I like mine a little crispy,” he said.

\n\nAs he listened to his daughter plate what he imagined were blackened sandwiches, Mirko thought about how nobody had seen his wife when she drove off in the afternoon as he delivered arugula and Marija played in a neighboring apartment. He had asked the neighbors, who, despite the scuffed paint on the wall leading down the staircase and out the building’s entrance, professed to having seen nothing. When Mirko asked if they’d at least heard anything, the banging of furniture or the hushed voices of whispering adults, they shook their heads.

\n\nBy now all Mirko knew of his wife’s new lover was that he sold tourmaline, which cost less than quartz in most places around the state. A cheap stone, despite its array of colors. A stone formed from crystalized minerals and cooled liquids. A stone, simply put. Mirko wondered how much a decade-old AC would earn his wife. He wondered if the profit from an old furniture set would last her a month, and how many tourmaline rings and how many tourmaline necklaces her new lover would have to sell to make the difference.

\n\nThe more Mirko thought about her, the more he had trouble remembering the exact details of her physicality. Had the dimple been on the right side of her face or the left?

\n\n“Come here, goose,” he called his daughter back to the stale blue couch, telling her to leave the sandwiches in the kitchen to cool.

\n\n\nSmile for me, goose. Had her eyes been deep set or shallow? Keep them shut, goose. Had the bridge of her nose fallen into a slope or remained straight down to the cartilage? Stop flinching, goose. Mirko ached like a man it hurt to watch.



\n\nLeaves burst into color, and catching the sun of the early morning, they shimmered like batches of jewels hanging from the sky. This, Mirko could not see.

\n\nHe held his daughter’s hand as she guided him to the farm. He wore a pair of sunglasses over his eyes, shielding his sickness from any chance passerby.

\n\nOnce in the driver’s seat, Mirko felt the familiar curve of the gear stick, tracing the seam that tightly bound the leather to itself with his rough, worn hands. He knew the roads well enough to manage the shifting on his own, he could feel the heavy piece of machinery work when it went up an incline, the vehicle pouring out all of its energy. Similarly, he knew that he could distinguish the feel of his truck when it coasted downwards, picking up speed like an avalanche moments after its fracture.

\n\nWhat he didn’t know, and what he couldn’t feel, was the curve of the road. This is why he needed Marija. She would need to tell him when he drifted towards the median, when he needed to slow for a turn. She would need to be his compass. His speedometer. His eyes.

\n\n“Am I clear?” Mirko asked.

\n\nMarija’s voice was hesitant. “Clear.”

\n\nHe lightly pressed down on the pedal, feeling the weight of the truck bounce around him as it crawled forward and away from the farm.

\n\n“Okay, a little faster. Stay straight.”

\n\nMirko obeyed his daughter. He tried visualizing the road in his mind, but nothing materialized in the heavy black space that had enveloped him. Instead, his thoughts took him back to the beginning of July. It had all happened overnight.

\n\n“You’re not on your side.” Marija reached for the wheel and guided his hands.

\n\nAlone in his mind’s grotto, Mirko listened. He listened to every creak and every rattle that the cab made. When he heard an oncoming vehicle coming down the road, his daughter gripped his hands more firmly and told her father to slow down. The vehicle passed with a surge of wind that felt as if a ghost had just rushed through them.

\n\n“What was that?” he shouted at his daughter who was now crying.

\n\n“A truck,” she wept. “Another truck.” Her wails subsided to whimpers.

\n\n “Don’t cry, my sweet goose. Don’t cry.” Mirko lifted his hand to place it on Marija’s shoulder, but the instability of the wheel made him immediately replace it. After a minute of quiet, punctuated by Marija’s shortened breaths, Mirko spoke.

\n\n“What do you see?” he asked his daughter.

\n\n“Trees. Lots of trees.” Her distress was easing.

\n\n“What else?”

\n\n“A big rock.”

\n\n“Is it graffitied?”

\n\n“What?”

\n\n“Is it painted?”

\n\n“It had a face.”

\n\nMirko knew the house.

\n\n“We’re nearing the intersection. Then we’ll go left,” he told his daughter.

\n\n“I know!” she replied with the anger of a child.

\n\n“I know you know, goose.”

\n\nMarija was quiet for the next mile as she held onto her father’s hands that gripped the wheel. She was playing her part. “Okay, slow down. Slower. Slower. Slower. Okay, stop!”

\n\nMirko’s foot slammed down on the brake. There was a heavy jolt that shook them both. He could tell that the cooler, wetter weather was upsetting the roads. His daughter told him when the light turned green.

\n\nMarija directed, “Okay, start turning. More. More. Okay, stop. Stop turning now,” a sense of urgency in her voice. The truck continued onward, bouncing along the dirt path, slowly but with a purpose. Mirko knew the rest of the route was a direct shot to Smedburg’s. The pair traveled along in silence, Marija continuing to correct his steering.

\n\nJust as the quiet had settled, and just as the moment had felt, almost, like one that any father and daughter might have on any given day, Marija spoke. “When will she be back from vacation?”

\n\nHe felt his daughter move her hands off of his and onto the wheel itself.

\n\nMarija saw all that Mirko couldn’t.

\n\nA weathered shed with a tilted metal compass, a rusted mailbox losing its color, and a stone wall that was covered in moss flew past them. The outside world seemed to speed by faster and faster, turning into a blur that made it difficult to render, had anybody been looking out the side windows.

\n\n“Do you remember what mama was wearing the last time you saw her?” Mirko at last asked. Marija didn’t speak. She wondered why he asked this. “Do you remember if she was wearing her purple dress with the flowers? Or was she wearing her blue dress?” he continued. Still, she remained quiet, hesitant to answer. They traveled along in silence, passing the towers of forest that surrounded them on either side.

\n\n“What is it that you’re wearing today, my little goose?” Her father felt for her hands. As he did, the truck began to drift. The machine crossed the median, though there was no divider visible on the dirt road. The girl pulled away from her father. She released her grip. “My goose,” he said again, grabbing her at the elbow, and holding her hands down to the wheel. The child sobbed. The man pleaded, “Don’t cry, my goose. You look so ugly when you cry.”

\n\nWhen the sound approached, it rose up from the whisperings of a muted hum, growing in power and proximity until it became like the growl of a predator ready to feast. While Marija was certain that her father heard it, it was only she who could see the truck coming towards them. The semi blared its horn. Mirko released his grip, and Marija jerked the truck’s wheel away from the oncoming traffic. The eighteen-wheeler loomed beside them as it passed, its mirror nearly striking their cab. Its weight rocked them. After its rumble faded into the distance, and their own truck came to a slow stop, Marija looked up at her father. Now it was he who sobbed.

\n\n Marija got out of the truck. She saw the lettuce that had plummeted from the bed during the vehicle’s abrupt swerve. The iceberg heads were coated with mud. Marija began gathering them in her shirt, their drippings falling through her chilled fingers. She continued doing this until she heard her father calling her back to the cab of the truck. Her arms filled with produce that could not be salvaged, the child made her way.

MAMZELLE AURLIE possessed a good strong figure, ruddy cheeks, hair that was changing from brown to gray, and a determined eye. She wore a man\'s hat about the farm, and an old blue army overcoat when it was cold, and sometimes top-boots.\n\n

Mamzelle Aurlie had never thought of marrying. She had never been in love. At the age of twenty she had received a proposal, which she had promptly declined, and at the age of fifty she had not yet lived to regret it.\n\n

So she was quite alone in the world, except for her dog Ponto, and the negroes who lived in her cabins and worked her crops, and the fowls, a few cows, a couple of mules, her gun (with which she shot chicken-hawks), and her religion\n\n.

One morning Mamzelle Aurlie stood upon her gallery, contemplating, with arms akimbo, a small band of very small children who, to all intents and purposes, might have fallen from the clouds, so unexpected and bewildering was their coming, and so unwelcome. They were the children of her nearest neighbor, Odile, who was not such a near neighbor, after all.\n\n

The young woman had appeared but five minutes before, accompanied by these four children. In her arms she carried little Lodie; she dragged Ti Nomme by an unwilling hand; while Marcline and Marclette followed with irresolute steps.\n\n

Her face was red and disfigured from tears and excitement. She had been summoned to a neighboring parish by the dangerous illness of her mother; her husband was away in Texas — it seemed to her a million miles away; and Valsin was waiting with the mule-cart to drive her to the station.\n\n

\"It\'s no question, Mamzelle Aurlie; you jus\' got to keep those youngsters fo\' me tell I come back. Dieu sait, I wouldn\' botha you with \'em if it was any otha way to do! Make \'em mine you, Mamzelle Aurlie; don\' spare \'em. Me, there, I\'m half crazy between the chil\'ren, an\' Lon not home, an\' maybe not even to fine po\' maman alive encore!\" — a harrowing possibility which drove Odile to take a final hasty and convulsive leave of her disconsolate family.\n\n



THE excitement was all over, and they were gone. How still it was when they were gone! Mamzelle Aurlie stood upon the gallery, looking and listening. She could no longer see the cart; the red sunset and the blue-gray twilight had together flung a purple mist across the fields and road that hid it from her view. She could no longer hear the wheezing and creaking of its wheels. But she could still faintly hear the shrill, glad voices of the children.\n\n

She turned into the house. There was much work awaiting her, for the children had left a sad disorder behind them; but she did not at once set about the task of righting it. Mamzelle Aurlie seated herself beside the table. She gave one slow glance through the room, into which the evening shadows were creeping and deepening around her solitary figure. She let her head fall down upon her bended arm, and began to cry. Oh, but she cried! Not softly, as women often do. She cried like a man, with sobs that seemed to tear her very soul. She did not notice Ponto licking her hand.\n\n

She left them crowded into the narrow strip of shade on the porch of the long, low house; the white sunlight was beating in on the white old boards; some chickens were scratching in the grass at the foot of the steps, and one had boldly mounted, and was stepping heavily, solemnly, and aimlessly across the gallery. There was a pleasant odor of pinks in the air, and the sound of negroes\' laughter was coming across the flowering cotton-field.\n\n

Mamzelle Aurlie stood contemplating the children. She looked with a critical eye upon Marcline, who had been left staggering beneath the weight of the chubby Lodie. She surveyed with the same calculating air Marclette mingling her silent tears with the audible grief and rebellion of Ti Nomme. During those few contemplative moments she was collecting herself, determining upon a line of action which should be identical with a line of duty. She began by feeding them.\n\n

If Mamzelle Aurlie\'s responsibilities might have begun and ended there, they could easily have been dismissed; for her larder was amply provided against an emergency of this nature. But little children are not little pigs: they require and demand attentions which were wholly unexpected by Mamzelle Aurlie, and which she was ill prepared to give.\n\n

She was, indeed, very inapt in her management of Odile\'s children during the first few days. How could she know that Marclette always wept when spoken to in a loud and commanding tone of voice? It was a peculiarity of Marclette\'s. She became acquainted with Ti Nomme\'s passion for flowers only when he had plucked all the choicest gardenias and pinks for the apparent purpose of critically studying their botanical construction.\n\n

\"\'T ain\'t enough to tell \'im, Mamzelle Aurlie,\" Marcline instructed her; \"you got to tie \'im in a chair. It\'s w\'at maman all time do w\'en he\'s bad: she tie \'im in a chair.\" The chair in which Mamzelle Aurlie tied Ti Nomme was roomy and comfortable, and he seized the opportunity to take a nap in it, the afternoon being warm.\n\n

At night, when she ordered them one and all to bed as she would have shooed the chickens into the hen-house, they stayed uncomprehending before her. What about the little white nightgowns that had to be taken from the pillow-slip in which they were brought over, and shaken by some strong hand till they snapped like ox-whips? What about the tub of water which had to be brought and set in the middle of the floor, in which the little tired, dusty, sun-browned feet had every one to be washed sweet and clean? And it made Marcline and Marclette laugh merrily — the idea that Mamzelle Aurlie should for a moment have believed that Ti Nomme could fall asleep without being told the story of Croque-mitaine or Loup-garou, or both; or that lodie could fall asleep at all without being rocked and sung to.\n\n

\"I tell you, Aunt Ruby,\" Mamzelle Aurlie informed her cook in confidence; \"me, I\'d rather manage a dozen plantation\' than fo\' chil\'ren. It\'s terrassent! Bont! don\'t talk to me about chil\'ren!\"\n\n

\"T ain\' ispected sich as you would know airy thing \'bout \'em, Mamzelle Aurlie. I see dat plainly yistiddy w\'en I spy dat li\'le chile playin\' wid yo\' baskit o\' keys. You don\' know dat makes chillun grow up hard-headed, to play wid keys? Des like it make \'em teeth hard to look in a lookin\'-glass. Them\'s the things you got to know in the raisin\' an\' manigement o\' chillun.\"\n\n

Mamzelle Aurlie certainly did not pretend or aspire to such subtle and far-reaching knowledge on the subject as Aunt Ruby possessed, who had \"raised five an\' buried six\" in her day. She was glad enough to learn a few little mother-tricks to serve the moment\'s need.\n\n

Ti Nomme\'s sticky fingers compelled her to unearth white aprons that she had not worn for years, and she had to accustom herself to his moist kisses — the expressions of an affectionate and exuberant nature. She got down her sewing-basket, which she seldom used, from the top shelf of the armoire, and placed it within the ready and easy reach which torn slips and buttonless waists demanded. It took her some days to become accustomed to the laughing, the crying, the chattering that echoed through the house and around it all day long. And it was not the first or the second night that she could sleep comfortably with little Lodie\'s hot, plump body pressed close against her, and the little one\'s warm breath beating her cheek like the fanning of a bird\'s wing.\n\n

But at the end of two weeks Mamzelle Aurlie had grown quite used to these things, and she no longer complained.\n\n

It was also at the end of two weeks that Mamzelle Aurlie, one evening, looking away toward the crib where the cattle were being fed, saw Valsin\'s blue cart turning the bend of the road. Odile sat beside the mulatto, upright and alert. As they drew near, the young woman\'s beaming face indicated that her home-coming was a happy one.\n\n

But this coming, unannounced and unexpected, threw Mamzelle Aurlie into a flutter that was almost agitation. The children had to be gathered. Where was Ti Nomme? Yonder in the shed, putting an edge on his knife at the grindstone. And Marcline and Marclette? Cutting and fashioning doll-rags in the corner of the gallery. As for Lodie, she was safe enough in Mamzelle Aurlie\'s arms; and she had screamed with delight at sight of the familiar blue cart which was bringing her mother back to her.\n\n

THE sun was just far enough in the west to send inviting shadows. In the centre of a small field, and in the shade of a haystack which was there, a girl lay sleeping. She had slept long and soundly, when something awoke her as suddenly as if it had been a blow. She opened her eyes and stared a moment up in the cloudless sky. She yawned and stretched her long brown legs and arms, lazily. Then she arose, never minding the bits of straw that clung to her black hair, to her red bodice, and the blue cotonade skirt that did not reach her naked ankles.\n\n
The log cabin in which she dwelt with her parents was just outside the enclosure in which she had been sleeping. Beyond was a small clearing that did duty as a cotton field. All else was dense wood, except the long stretch that curved round the brow of the hill, and in which glittered the steel rails of the Texas and Pacific road.\n\n
When Caline emerged from the shadow she saw a long train of passenger coaches standing in view, where they must have stopped abruptly. It was that sudden stopping which had awakened her; for such a thing had not happened before within her recollection, and she looked stupid, at first, with astonishment. There seemed to be something wrong with the engine; and some of the passengers who dismounted went forward to investigate the trouble. Others came strolling along in the direction of the cabin, where Caline stood under an old gnarled mulberry tree, staring. Her father had halted his mule at the end of the cotton row, and stood staring also, leaning upon his plow.\n\n
There were ladies in the party. They walked awkwardly in their high-heeled boots over the rough, uneven ground, and held up their skirts mincingly. They twirled parasols over their shoulders, and laughed immoderately at the funny things which their masculine companions were saying.\n\n
They tried to talk to Caline, but could not understand the French patois with which she answered them.\n

One of the men - a pleasant-faced youngster - drew a sketch book from his pocket and began to make a picture of the girl. She stayed motionless, her hands behind her, and her wide eyes fixed earnestly upon him.\n\n
Before he had finished there was a summons from the train; and all went scampering hurriedly away. The engine screeched, it sent a few lazy puffs into the still air, and in another moment or two had vanished, bearing its human cargo with it.\n\n
Caline could not feel the same after that. She looked with new and strange interest upon the trains of cars that passed so swiftly back and forth across her vision, each day; and wondered whence these people came, and whither they were going.\n\n
Her mother and father could not tell her, except to say that they came from \"loin là bas,\" and were going \"Djieu sait é où.\"\n

One day she walked miles down the track to talk with the old flagman, who stayed down there by the big water tank. Yes, he knew. Those people came from the great cities in the north, and were going to the city in the south. He knew all about the city; it was a grand place. He had lived there once. His sister lived there now; and she would be glad enough to have so fine a girl as Caline to help her cook and scrub, and tend the babies. And he thought Caline might earn as much as five dollars a month, in the city.\n\n
So she went; in a new cotonade, and her Sunday shoes; with a sacredly guarded scrawl that the flagman sent to his sister.\n

The woman lived in a tiny, stuccoed house, with green blinds, and three wooden steps leading down to the banquette. There seemed to be hundreds like it along the street. Over the house tops loomed the tall masts of ships, and the hum of the French market could be heard on a still morning.\n\n
Caline was at first bewildered. She had to readjust all her preconceptions to fit the reality of it. The flagman\'s sister was a kind and gentle task-mistress. At the end of a week or two she wanted to know how the girl liked it all. Caline liked it very well, for it was pleasant, on Sunday afternoons, to stroll with the children under the great, solemn sugar sheds; or to sit upon the compressed cotton bales, watching the stately steamers, the graceful boats, and noisy little tugs that plied the waters of the Mississippi. And it filled her with agreeable excitement to go to the French market, where the handsome Gascon butchers were eager to present their compliments and little Sunday bouquets to the pretty Acadian girl; and to throw fistfuls of lagniappe into her basket.\n\n
When the woman asked her again after another week if she were still pleased, she was not so sure. And again when she questioned Caline the girl turned away, and went to sit behind the big, yellow cistern, to cry unobserved. For she knew now that it was not the great city and its crowds of people she had so eagerly sought; but the pleasant-faced boy, who had made her picture that day under the mulberry tree.\n\n

\“The old man clawed and spat at me through the moldy air, and barked things in his
throat as he swayed with the yellow curtain he clutched.\"\n\n


I saw him on a sleepless night when I was walking desperately
to save my soul and my vision. My coming to New York had
been a mistake; for whereas I had looked for poignant wonder
and inspiration in the teeming labyrinths of ancient streets that
twist endlessly from forgotten courts and squares and
waterfronts to courts and squares and waterfronts equally
forgotten, and in the Cyclopean modern towers and pinnacles
that rise blackly Babylonian under waning moons, I had found
instead only a sense of horror and oppression which
threatened to master, paralyze, and annihilate me\n\n

The disillusion had been gradual. Coming for the first time
upon the town, I had seen it in the sunset from a bridge, majestic above its waters, its incredible peaks and pyramids
rising flowerlike and delicate from pools of violet mist to play
with the flaming golden clouds and the first stars of evening. Then it had lighted up window by window above the
shimmering tides where lanterns nodded and glided and deep
horns bayed weird harmonies, and had itself become a starry
firmament of dream, redolent of faery music, and one with the
marvels of Carcassonne and Samarcand and El Dorado and all
glorious and half-fabulous cities. Shortly afterward I was taken
through those antique ways so dear to my fancy—narrow, curving alleys and passages where rows of red Georgian brick
blinked with small-paned dormers above pillared doorways
that had looked on gilded sedans and paneled coaches—and in
the first flush of realization of these long-wished things I
thought I had indeed achieved such treasures as would make
me in time a poet\n\n

But success and happiness were not to be. Garish daylight
showed only squalor and alienage and the noxious
elephantiasis of climbing, spreading stone where the moon had
hinted of loveliness and elder magic; and the throngs of people
that seethed through the flumelike streets were squat, swarthy
strangers with hardened faces and narrow eyes, shrewd
strangers without dreams and without kinship to the scenes
about them, who could never mean aught to a blue-eyed man
of the old folk, with the love of fair green lanes and white New
England village steeples in his heart\n\n

So instead of the poems I had hoped for, there came only a
shuddering blankness and ineffable loneliness; and I saw at
last a fearful truth which no one had ever dared to breathe
before—the unwhisperable secret of secrets—the fact that this
city of stone and stridor is not a sentient perpetuation of Old
New York as London is of Old London and Paris of Old Paris, but that it is in fact quite dead, its sprawling body imperfectly
embalmed and infested with queer animate things which have
nothing to do with it as it was in life. Upon making this
discovery I ceased to sleep comfortably; though something of
resigned tranquillity came back as I gradually formed the habit
of keeping off the streets by day and venturing abroad only at
night, when darkness calls forth what little of the past still
hovers wraithlike about, and old white doorways remember
the stalwart forms that once passed through them. With this
mode of relief I even wrote a few poems, and still refrained
from going home to my people lest I seem to crawl back
ignobly in defeat.\n\n

Then, on a sleepless night’s walk, I met the man. It was in a
grotesque hidden courtyard of the Greenwich section, for there
in my ignorance I had settled, having heard of the place as the
natural home of poets and artists. The archaic lanes and houses
and unexpected bits of square and court had indeed delighted
me, and when I found the poets and artists to be loud-voiced
pretenders whose quaintness is tinsel and whose lives are a
denial of all that pure beauty which is poetry and art, I stayed
on for love of these venerable things. I fancied them as they
were in their prime, when Greenwich was a placid village not
yet engulfed by the town; and in the hours before dawn, when
all the revellers had slunk away, I used to wander alone among
their cryptical windings and brood upon the curious arcana
which generations must have deposited there. This kept my
soul alive, and gave me a few of those dreams and visions for
which the poet far within me cried out.\n\n

The man came upon me at about 2 one cloudy August morning, as I was threading a series of detached courtyards; now
accessible only through the unlighted hallways of intervening
buildings, but once forming parts of a continuous network of
picturesque alleys. I had heard of them by vague rumor, and
realized that they could not be upon any map of today; but the
fact that they were forgotten only endeared them to me, so that
I had sought them with twice my usual eagerness. Now that I
had found them, my eagerness was again redoubled; for
something in their arrangement dimly hinted that they might
be only a few of many such, with dark, dumb counterparts
wedged obscurely betwixt high blank walls and deserted rear
tenements, or lurking lamplessly behind archways, unbetrayed
by hordes of the foreign-speaking or guarded by furtive and
uncommunicative artists whose practises do not invite
publicity or the light of day\n\n

He spoke to me without invitation, noting my mood and
glances as I studied certain knockered doorways above iron- railed steps, the pallid glow of traceried transoms feebly
lighting my face. His own face was in shadow, and he wore a
wide-brimmed hat which somehow blended perfectly with the
out-of-date cloak he affected; but I was subtly disquieted even
before he addressed me. His form was very slight, thin almost
to cadaverousness; and his voice proved phenomenally soft
and hollow, though not particularly deep. He had, he said,\n
noticed me several times at my wanderings; and inferred that I
resembled him in loving the vestiges of former years. Would I
not like the guidance of one long practised in these
explorations, and possessed of local information profoundly
deeper than any which an obvious newcomer could possibly
have gained?\n\n

As he spoke, I caught a glimpse of his face in the yellow beam
from a solitary attic window. It was a noble, even a handsome, elderly countenance; and bore the marks of a lineage and
refinement unusual for the age and place. Yet some quality
about it disturbed me almost as much as its features pleased
me—perhaps it was too white, or too expressionless, or too
much out of keeping with the locality, to make me feel easy or
comfortable. Nevertheless I followed him; for in those dreary
days my quest for antique beauty and mystery was all that I
had to keep my soul alive, and I reckoned it a rare favor of Fate
to fall in with one whose kindred seekings seemed to have
penetrated so much farther than mine.\n\n

Something in the night constrained the cloaked man to silence, and for a long hour he led me forward without needless words;
making only the briefest of comments concerning ancient
names and dates and changes, and directing my progress very
largely by gestures as we squeezed through interstices, tiptoed
through corridors, clambered over brick walls, and once
crawled on hands and knees through a low, arched passage of
stone whose immense length and tortuous twistings effaced at
last every hint of geographical location I had managed to
preserve. The things we saw were very old and marvelous, or
at least they seemed so in the few straggling rays of light by
which I viewed them, and I shall never forget the tottering
Ionic columns and fluted pilasters and urn-headed iron
fenceposts and flaring-linteled windows and decorative
fanlights that appeared to grow quainter and stranger the
deeper we advanced into this inexhaustible maze of unknown
antiquity.\n\n

We met no person, and as time passed the lighted windows
became fewer and fewer. The streetlights we first encountered
had been of oil, and of the ancient lozenge pattern. Later I
noticed some with candles; and at last, after traversing a
horrible unlighted court where my guide had to lead me with
his gloved hand through total blackness to a narrow wooden
gate in a high wall, we came upon a fragment of alley lit only by
lanterns in front of every seventh house—unbelievably
Colonial tin lanterns with conical tops and holes punched in
the sides. This alley led steeply uphill—more steeply than I had
thought possible in this part of New York—and the upper end
was blocked squarely by the ivy-clad wall of a private estate, beyond which I could see a pale cupola, and the tops of trees
waving against a vague lightness in the sky. In this wall was a
small, low-arched gate of nail-studded black oak, which the
man proceeded to unlock with a ponderous key. Leading me
within, he steered a course in utter blackness over what
seemed to be a gravel path, and finally up a flight of stone steps
to the door of the house, which he unlocked and opened for me.\n\n

We entered, and as we did so I grew faint from a reek of
infinite mustiness which welled out to meet us, and which
must have been the fruit of unwholesome centuries of decay. My host appeared not to notice this, and in courtesy I kep
silent as he piloted me up a curving stairway, across a hall, and
into a room whose door I heard him lock behind us. Then I saw
him pull the curtains of the three small-paned windows that
barely showed themselves against the lightening sky; after
which he crossed to the mantel, struck flint and steel, lighted
two candles of a candelabrum of twelve sconces, and made a
gesture enjoining soft-toned speech.\n\n

In this feeble radiance I saw that we were in a spacious, well-furnished and paneled library dating from the first quarter of
the Eighteenth Century, with splendid doorway pediments, a
delightful Doric cornice, and a magnificently carved
overmantel with scroll-and-urn top. Above the crowded
bookshelves at intervals along the walls were well-wrought
family portraits; all tarnished to an enigmatical dimness, and
bearing an unmistakable likeness to the man who now
motioned me to a chair beside the graceful Chippendale table. Before seating himself across the table from me, my host
paused for a moment as if in embarrassment; then, tardily
removing his gloves, wide-brimmed hat, and cloak, stood
theatrically revealed in full mid-Georgian costume from
queued hair and neck ruffles to knee-breeches, silk hose, and
the buckled shoes I had not previously noticed. Now slowly
sinking into a lyre-back chair, he commenced to eye me
intently.\n\n

Without his hat he took on an aspect of extreme age which was
scarcely visible before, and I wondered if this unperceived
mark of singular longevity were not one of the sources of my
original disquiet. When he spoke at length, his soft, hollow, and
carefully muffled voice not infrequently quavered; and now
and then I had great difficulty in following him as I listened
with a thrill of amazement and half-disavowed alarm which
grew each instant.\n\n

\“You behold, Sir,\” my host began, \“a man of very eccentrical
habits, for whose costume no apology need be offered to one
with your wit and inclinations. Reflecting upon better times, I
have not scrupled to ascertain their ways and adopt their dress
and manners; an indulgence which offends none if practised
without ostentation. It hath been my good fortune to retain the
rural seat of my ancestors, swallowed though it was by two
towns, first Greenwich, which built up hither after 1800, then
New York, which joined on near 1830. There were many
reasons for the close keeping of this place in my family, and I
have not been remiss in discharging such obligations. The
squire who succeeded to it in 1768 studied sartain arts and
made sartain discoveries, all connected with influences
residing in this particular plot of ground, and eminently
desarving of the strongest guarding. Some curious effects of
these arts and discoveries I now purpose to show you, under
the strictest secrecy; and I believe I may rely on my judgment
of men enough to have no distrust of either your interest or
your fidelity.\”\n\n

He paused, but I could only nod my head. I have said that I was
alarmed, yet to my soul nothing was more deadly than the
material daylight world of New York, and whether this man
were a harmless eccentric or a wielder of dangerous arts I had
no choice save to follow him and slake my sense of wonder on
whatever he might have to offer. So I listened.\n\n

\“To—my ancestor,\” he softly continued, \“there appeared to
reside some very remarkable qualities in the will of mankind;
qualities having a little-suspected dominance not only over the
acts of one’s self and of others, but over every variety of force
and substance in Nature, and over many elements and
dimensions deemed more universal than Nature herself. May I
say that he flouted the sanctity of things as great as space and
time and that he put to strange uses the rites of sartain half- breed red Indians once encamped upon this hill? These Indians
showed choler when the place was built, and were plaguey
pestilent in asking to visit the grounds at the full of the moon. For years they stole over the wall each month when they could, and by stealth performed sartain acts. Then, in \’68, the new
squire catched them at their doings, and stood still at what he
saw. Thereafter he bargained with them and exchanged the
free access of his grounds for the exact inwardness of what
they did; larning that their grandfathers got part of their
custom from red ancestors and part from an old Dutchman in
the time of the States-General. And pox on him, I\’m afeared the
squire must have sarved them monstrous bad rum—whether
or not by intent—for a week after he larnt the secret he was
the only man living that knew it. You, Sir, are the first outsider
to be told there is a secret, and split me if I\’d have risked
tampering that much with—the powers—had ye not been so
hot after bygone things.\”\n\n

I shuddered as the man grew colloquial—and with the familiar
speech of another day. He went on.\n\n

\“But you must know, Sir, that what—the squire—got from
those mongrel salvages was but a small part of the larning he
came to have. He had not been at Oxford for nothing, nor talked
to no account with an ancient chymist and astrologer in Paris. He was, in fine, made sensible that all the world is but the
smoke of our intellects; past the bidding of the vulgar, but by
the wise to be puffed out and drawn in like any cloud of prime
Virginia tobacco. What we want, we may make about us; and
what we don\’t want, we may sweep away. I won\’t say that all
this is wholly true in body, but \’tis sufficient true to furnish a
very pretty spectacle now and then. You, I conceive, would be
tickled by a better sight of sartain other years than your fancy
affords you; so be pleased to hold back any fright at what I
design to show. Come to the window and be quiet.\n\n

My host now took my hand to draw me to one of the two
windows on the long side of the malodorous room, and at the
first touch of his ungloved fingers I turned cold. His flesh, though dry and firm, was of the quality of ice; and I almost
shrank away from his pulling. But again I thought of the
emptiness and horror of reality, and boldly prepared to follow
whithersoever I might be led. Once at the window, the man
drew apart the yellow silk curtains and directed my stare into
the blackness outside. For a moment I saw nothing save a
myriad of tiny dancing lights, far, far before me. Then, as if in
response to an insidious motion of my host’s hand, a flash of
heat-lightning played over the scene, and I looked out upon a
sea of luxuriant foliage—foliage unpolluted, and not the sea of
roofs to be expected by any normal mind. On my right the
Hudson glittered wickedly, and in the distance ahead I saw the
unhealthy shimmer of a vast salt marsh constellated with
nervous fireflies. The flash died, and an evil smile illumined the
waxy face of the aged  necromancer.\n\n

\"That was before my time—before the new squire\’s time. Pray
let us try again.\"\n\n

I was faint, even fainter than the hateful modernity of that
accursed city had made me.\n\n

\“Good God!\” I whispered; \“can you do that for any time?\” And
as he nodded, and bared the black stumps of what had once
been yellow fangs, I clutched at the curtains to prevent myself
from falling. But he steadied me with that terrible, ice-cold
claw, and once more made his insidious gesture.\n\n

Again the lightning flashed—but this time upon a scene not
wholly strange. It was Greenwich, the Greenwich that used to
be, with here and there a roof or row of houses as we see it
now, yet with lovely green lanes and fields and bits of grassy
common. The marsh still glittered beyond, but in the farther
distance I saw the steeples of what was then all of New York;
Trinity and St. Paul\’s and the Brick Church dominating their
sisters, and a faint haze of wood smoke hovering over the
whole. I breathed hard, but not so much from the sight itself as
from the possibilities my imagination terrifiedly conjured up. \n\n

\“Can you—dare you—go far?\” I spoke with awe, and I think he
shared it for a second, but the evil grin returned. \n\n

\“Far? What I have seen would blast ye to a mad statue of stone!
Back, back—forward, forward—look, ye puling lack-wit!\” \n\n

And as he snarled the phrase under his breath he gestured
anew; bringing to the sky a flash more blinding than either
which had come before. For full three seconds I could glimpse
that pandemoniac sight, and in those seconds I saw a vista
which will ever afterward torment me in dreams. I saw the
heavens verminous with strange flying things, and beneath
them a hellish black city of giant stone terraces with impious
pyramids flung savagely to the moon, and devil-lights burning
from unnumbered windows. And swarming loathsomely on
aerial galleries I saw the yellow, squint-eyed people of that city, robed horribly in orange and red, and dancing insanely to the
pounding of fevered kettle-drums, the clatter of obscene
crotala, and the maniacal moaning of muted horns whose
ceaseless dirges rose and fell undulantly like the waves of an
unhallowed ocean of bitumen.\n\n

I saw this vista, I say, and heard as with the mind’s ear the
blasphemous domdaniel of cacophony which companioned it. It was the shrieking fulfilment of all the horror which that
corpse-city had ever stirred in my soul, and forgetting every
injunction to silence I screamed and screamed and screamed
as my nerves gave way and the walls quivered about me.\n\n

Then, as the flash subsided, I saw that my host was trembling
too; a look of shocking fear half-blotting from his face the
serpent distortion of rage which my screams had excited. He
tottered, clutched at the curtains as I had done before, and
wriggled his head wildly, like a hunted animal. God knows he
had cause, for as the echoes of my screaming died away there
came another sound so hellishly suggestive that only numbed
emotion kept me sane and conscious. It was the steady, stealthy creaking of the stairs beyond the locked door, as with
the ascent of a barefoot or skin-shod horde; and at last the
cautious, purposeful rattling of the brass latch that glowed in
the feeble candlelight. The old man clawed and spat at me
through the moldy air, and barked things in his throat as he
swayed with the yellow curtain he clutched.\n\n

\“The full moon—damn ye—ye . . . ye yelping dog—ye
called \’em, and they’ve come for me! Moccasined feet—dead
men—Gad sink ye, ye red devils, but I poisoned no rum o\’ yours—han\’t I kept your pox-rotted magic safe?—ye swilled
yourselves sick, curse ye, and ye must needs blame the
squire—let go, you! Unhand that latch—I’ve naught for ye
here——\” \n\n

At this point three slow and very deliberate raps shook the
panels of the door, and a white foam gathered at the mouth of
the frantic magician. His fright, turning to steely despair, left
room for a resurgence of his rage against me; and he staggered
a step toward the table on whose edge I was steadying myself. The curtains, still clutched in his right hand as his left clawed
out at me, grew taut and finally crashed down from their lofty
fastenings; admitting to the room a flood of that full moonlight
which the brightening of the sky had presaged. In those
greenish beams the candles paled, and a new semblance of
decay spread over the musk-reeking room with its wormy
paneling, sagging floor, battered mantel, rickety furniture, and
ragged draperies. It spread over the old man, too, whether
from the same source or because of his fear and vehemence, and I saw him shrivel and blacken as he lurched near and
strove to rend me with vulturine talons. Only his eyes stayed
whole, and they glared with a propulsive, dilated
incandescence which grew as the face around them charred
and dwindled.\n\n

The rapping was now repeated with greater insistence, and
this time bore a hint of metal. The black thing facing me had
become only a head with eyes, impotently trying to wriggle
across the sinking floor in my direction, and occasionally
emitting feeble little spits of immortal malice. Now swift and
splintering blows assailed the sickly panels, and I saw the
gleam of a tomahawk as it cleft the rending wood. I did not
move, for I could not; but watched dazedly as the door fell in
pieces to admit a colossal, shapeless influx of inky substance
starred with shining, malevolent eyes. It poured thickly, like a
flood of oil bursting a rotten bulkhead, overturned a chair as it
spread, and finally flowed under the table and across the room
to where the blackened head with the eyes still glared at me. Around that head it closed, totally swallowing it up, and in
another moment it had begun to recede; bearing away its
invisible burden without touching me, and flowing again out of
that black doorway and down the unseen stairs, which creaked
as before, though in reverse order.\n\n

Then the floor gave way at last, and I slid gaspingly down into
the nighted chamber below, choking with cobwebs and half- swooning with terror. The green moon, shining through
broken windows, showed me the hall door half open; and as I
rose from the plaster-strewn floor and twisted myself free
from the sagged ceiling, I saw sweep past it an awful torrent of
blackness, with scores of baleful eyes glowing in it. It was
seeking the door to the cellar, and when it found it, it vanished
therein. I now felt the floor of this lower room giving as that of
the upper chamber had done, and once a crashing above had
been followed by the fall past the west window of something
which must have been the cupola. Now liberated for the instant

from the wreckage, I rushed through the hall to the front door;
and finding myself unable to open it, seized a chair and broke a
window, climbing frenziedly out upon the unkempt lawn
where moonlight danced over yard-high grass and weeds. The
wall was high, and all the gates were locked; but moving a pile
of boxes in a corner I managed to gain the top and cling to the
great stone urn set there.\n\n

About me in my exhaustion I could see only strange walls and
windows and old gambrel roofs. The steep street of my
approach was nowhere visible, and the little I did see
succumbed rapidly to a mist that rolled in from the river
despite the glaring moonlight. Suddenly the urn to which I
clung began to tremble, as if sharing my own lethal dizziness;
and in another instant my body was plunging downward to I
knew not what fate. \n\n

The man who found me said that I must have crawled a long
way despite my broken bones, for a trail of blood stretched off
as far as he dared look. The gathering rain soon effaced this
link with the scene of my ordeal, and reports could state no
more than that I had appeared from a place unknown, at the
entrance of a little black court off Perry Street.\n\n

I never sought to return to those tenebrous labyrinths, nor
would I direct any sane man thither if I could. Of who or what
that ancient creature was, I have no idea; but I repeat that the
city is dead and full of unsuspected horrors. Whither he has
gone, I do not know; but I have gone home to the pure New
England lanes up which fragrant sea-winds sweep at evening.

        <item>
A man carrying a small red box in one hand walked slowly
down the street. His old straw hat and faded garments
looked as if the rain had often beaten upon them, and the
sun had as many times dried them upon his person. He was
not old, but he seemed feeble; and he walked in the sun,
along the blistering asphalt pavement. On the opposite side
of the street there were trees that threw a thick and pleasant
shade: people were all walking on that side. But the man
did not know, for he was blind, and moreover he was
stupid.\n\n

In the red box were lead pencils, which he was endeavoring
to sell. He carried no stick, but guided himself by trailing
his foot along the stone copings or his hand along the iron
railings. When he came to the steps of a house he would
mount them. Sometimes, after reaching the door with great
difficulty, he could not find the electric button, whereupon
he would patiently descend and go his way. Some of the
iron gates were locked, their owners being away for the
summer, and he would consume much time striving to open
them, which made little difference, as he had all the time
there was at his disposal.\n\n

At times he succeeded in finding the electric button: but the
man or maid who answered the bell needed no pencil, nor
could they be induced to disturb the mistress of the house
about so small a thing\n\n

The man had been out long and had walked far, but had
sold nothing. That morning someone who had finally grown
tired of having him hanging around had equipped him with
this box of pencils, and sent him out to make his living.
Hunger, with sharp fangs, was gnawing at his stomach and
a consuming thirst parched his mouth and tortured him. The
sun was broiling. He wore too much clothing—a vest and
coat over his shirt. He might have removed these and
carried them on his arm or thrown them away; but he did
not think of it. A kind woman who saw him from an upper
window felt sorry for him, and wished that he would cross
over into the shade.\n\n

The man drifted into a side street, where there was a group
of noisy, excited children at play. The color of the box
which he carried attracted them and they wanted to know
what was in it. One of them attempted to take it away from
him. With the instinct to protect his own and his only means
of sustenance, he resisted, shouted at the children and called
them names. A policeman coming round the corner and
seeing that he was the centre of a disturbance, jerked him
violently around by the collar; but upon perceiving that he
was blind, considerably refrained from clubbing him and
sent him on his way. He walked on in the sun.\n\n

During his aimless rambling he turned into a street where
there were monster electric cars thundering up and down,
clanging wild bells and literally shaking the ground beneath
his feet with their terrific impetus. He started to cross the
street.\n\n

Then something happened—something horrible happened
that made the women faint and the strongest men who saw
it grow sick and dizzy. The motorman\’s lips were as gray as
his face, and that was ashen gray; and he shook and
staggered from the superhuman effort he had put forth to
stop his car.\n\n

Where could the crowds have come from so suddenly,as if
by magic? Boys on the run, men and women tearing up on
their wheels to see the sickening sight: doctors dashing up
in buggies as if directed by Providence.\n\n

And the horror grew when the multitude recognized in the
dead and mangled figure one of the wealthiest, most useful
and most influential men of the town, a man noted for his
prudence and foresight. How could such a terrible fate have
overtaken him? He was hastening from his business house,
for he was late, to join his family, who were to start in an
hour or two for their summer home on the Atlantic coast. In
his hurry he did not perceive the other car coming from the
opposite direction and the common, harrowing thing was
repeated.\n\n

The blind man did not know what the commotion was all
about. He had crossed the street, and there he was,
stumbling on in the sun, trailing his foot along the coping.

I am tired. At the end of these years I am very tired. I have
been studying in books the languages of the living and
those we call dead. Early in the fresh morning I have
studied in books, and throughout the day when the sun was
shining; and at night when there were stars, I have lighted
my oil-lamp and studied in books. Now my brain is weary
and I want rest.\n\n

I shall sit here on the door-step beside my friend Paul. He is
an idle fellow with folded hands. He laughs when I upbraid
him, and bids me, with a motion, hold my peace. He is
listening to a thrush\’s song that comes from the blur of
yonder apple-tree. He tells me the thrush is singing a
complaint. She wants her mate that was with her last
blossom-time and builded a nest with her. She will have no
other mate. She will call for him till she hears the notes of
her beloved-one\’s song coming swiftly towards her across
forest and field.\n\n

Paul is a strange fellow. He gazed idly at a billowy white
cloud that rolls lazily over and over along the edge of the
blue sky.\n\n

He turns away from me and the words with which I would
instruct him, to drink deep the scent of the clover-field and
the thick perfume from the rose-hedge.\n\n

We rise from the door-step and walk together down the
gentle slope of the hill; past the apple-tree, and the ros-hedge; and along the border of the field where wheat is
growing. We walk down to the foot of the gentle slope
where women and men and children are living.\n\n

Paul is a strange fellow. He looks into the faces of people
who pass us by. He tells me that in their eyes he reads the
story of their souls. He knows men and women and the little
children, and why they look this way and that way. He
knows the reasons that turn them to and fro and cause them
to go and come. I think I shall walk a space through the
world with my friend Paul. He is very wise, he knows the
language of God which I have not learned.

When Randall, for a brief absence, left his Dorothea, whom
he was to marry after a time, the parting was bitter; the
enforced separation seemed to them too cruel an ordeal to
bear. The good-bye dragged with lingering kisses and sighs,
and more kisses and more clinging till the last wrench
came.\n\n

He was to return at the close of the month. Daily letters,
impassioned and interminable, passed between them.
He did not return at the close of the month; he was delayed
by illness. A heavy cold, accompanied by fever, contracted
in some unaccountable way, held him to his bed. He hoped
it would be over and that he would rejoin her in a week. But
this was a stubborn cold, that seemed not to yield to
familiar treatment; yet the physician was not discouraged,
and promised to have him on his feet in a fortnight.\n\n

All this was torture to the impatient Dorothea; and if her
parents had permitted, she surely would have hastened to
the bedside of her beloved.\n\n

For a long interval he could not write himself. One day he
seemed better; another day a \"fresh cold\" seized him with
relentless clutch; and so a second month went by, and
Dorothea had reached the limit of her endurance.\n\n

Then a tremulous scrawl came from him, saying he would
be obliged to pass a season at the south; but he would first
revisit his home, if only for a day, to clasp his dearest one to
his heart, to appease the hunger for her presence, the
craving for her lips that had been devouring him through all
the fever and pain of this detestable illness.\n\n

Dorothea had read his impassioned letters almost to tatters.
She had sat daily gazing for hours upon his portrait, which
showed him to be an almost perfect specimen of youthful
health, strength and manly beauty.\n\n

She knew he would be altered in appearance—he had
prepared her, and had even written that she would hardly
know him. She expected to see him ill and wasted; she
would not seem shocked; she would not let him see
astonishment or pain in her face. She was in a quiver of
anticipation, a sensuous fever of expectancy till he came.\n\n

She sat beside him on the sofa, for after the first delirious
embrace he had been unable to hold himself upon his
tottering feet, and had sunk exhausted in a corner of the
sofa. He threw his head back upon the cushions and stayed,
with closed eyes, panting; all the strength of his body had
concentrated in the clasp—the grasp with which he clung to
her hand.\n\n

She stared at him as one might look upon a curious
apparition which inspired wonder and mistrust rather than
fear. This was not the man who had gone away from her;
the man she loved and had promised to marry. What
revisit his home, if only for a day, to clasp his dearest one to
his heart, to appease the hunger for her presence, the
craving for her lips that had been devouring him through all
the fever and pain of this detestable illness.\n\n

Dorothea had read his impassioned letters almost to tatters.
She had sat daily gazing for hours upon his portrait, which
showed him to be an almost perfect specimen of youthful
health, strength and manly beauty.\n\n

She knew he would be altered in appearance—he had
prepared her, and had even written that she would hardly
know him. She expected to see him ill and wasted; she
would not seem shocked; she would not let him see
astonishment or pain in her face. She was in a quiver of
anticipation, a sensuous fever of expectancy till he came.\n\n

She sat beside him on the sofa, for after the first delirious
embrace he had been unable to hold himself upon his
tottering feet, and had sunk exhausted in a corner of the
sofa. He threw his head back upon the cushions and stayed,
with closed eyes, panting; all the strength of his body had
concentrated in the clasp—the grasp with which he clung to
her hand.\n\n

She stared at him as one might look upon a curious
apparition which inspired wonder and mistrust rather than
fear. This was not the man who had gone away from her;
the man she loved and had promised to marry. What
hideous transformation had he undergone, or what devilish
transformation was she undergoing in contemplating him?
His skin was waxy and hectic, red upon the cheek-bones.
His eyes were sunken; his features pinched and prominent;
and his clothing hung loosely upon his wasted frame. The
lips with which he had kissed her so hungrily, and with
which he was kissing her now, were dry and parched, and
his breath was feverish and tainted.\n\n

At the sight and the touch of him something within her
seemed to be shuddering, shrinking, shriveling together,
losing all semblance of what had been. She felt as if it was
her heart; but it was only her love.\n\n

\"This is the way my uncle Archibald went—in a gallop—you
know." He spoke with a certain derision and in little gasps
as if breath were failing him. \"There\'s no danger of that for
me, of course, once I get south; but the doctors won\'t
answer for me if I stay here during the coming fall and
winter.\"\n\n

Then he held her in his arms with what seemed to be a
frenzy of passion; a keen and quickened desire beside
which his former and healthful transports were tempered
and lukewarm by comparison.\n\n

\"We need not wait, Dorothea,\" he whispered. \"We must not
put it off. Let the marriage be at once, and you will come
with me and be with me. Oh, God! I feel as if I would never
let you go; as if I must hold you in my arms forever, night
and day, and always!\"\n\n

She attempted to withdraw from his embrace. She begged
him not to think of it, and tried to convince him that it was
impossible.
\"I would only be a hindrance, Randall. You will come back
well and strong; it will be time enough then,\" and to herself
she was saying: \"never, never, never!\" There was a long
silence, and he had closed his eyes again.\n\n

\"For another reason, my Dorothea,\" and then he waited
again, as one hesitates through shame or through fear, to
speak. \"I am quite - almost sure I shall get well; but the
strongest of us cannot count upon life. If the worst should
come I want you to have all I possess; what fortune I have
must be yours, and marriage will make my wish secure.
Now I'm getting morbid.\" He ended with a laugh that died
away in a cough which threatened to wrench the breath
from his body, and which brought the attendant, who had
waited without, quickly to his side.\n\n

Dorothea watched him from the window descend the steps,
leaning upon the man\'s arm, and saw him enter his carriage
and fall helpless and exhausted as he had sunk an hour
before in the corner of her sofa.\n\n

She was glad there was no one present to compel her to
speak. She stayed at the window as if dazed, looking
fixedly at the spot where the carriage had stood. A clock on
the mantel striking the hour finally roused her, and she
realized that there would soon be people appearing whom
she would be forced to face and speak to.
Fifteen minutes later Dorothea had changed her house
gown, had mounted her \"wheel,\" and was fleeing as if
Death himself pursued her.\n\n

She sped along the familiar roadway, seemingly borne on
by some force other than mechanical-some unw onted
energy—a stubborn impulse that lighted her eyes, set her
cheeks aflame, bent her supple body to one purpose—that
was, swiftest flight.\n\n

How far, and how long did she go? She did not know; she
did not care. The country about her grew unfamiliar. She
was on a rough, unfrequented road, where the birds in the
wayside brooks seemed unafraid. She could perceive no
human habitation; an old fallow field, a stretch of wood,
great trees bending thick-leaved branches languidly, and
flinging long, inviting shadows about the road; the woody
smell of summer; the drone of the insects; the sky and the
clouds, and the quivering, lambent air. She was alone with
nature; her pulses beating in unison with its sensuous throb,
as she stopped and stretched herself upon the sward. Every
muscle, nerve, fibre abandoned itself to the delicious
sensation of rest that overtook and crept tingling through
the whole length of her body.\n\n

She had never spoken a word after bidding him good-by;
but now she seemed disposed to make confidants of the
tremulous leaves, or the crawling and hopping insects, or
the big sky into which she was staring.\n\n

\"Never!\" she whispered, \"not for all his thousands! Never,
never! not for millions!\"
