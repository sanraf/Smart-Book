There was a village in Africa, that was very far from the waterhole, where they collect their
water from.
One day, while on the way to draw water from the waterhole, a girl had the misfortune to break
her rope holding her water-pot.
In great distress she cried out for a rope, and looking up she saw one hanging from a cloud,
like the ropes in the stories of God leaving the earth.
Climbing up she found a ruined village in the sky, and an old woman sitting there, that asked
what she wanted.\n\n

The girl told her story, and the old woman told her to continue walking, and if an ant crawled
up into her ear she must leave it alone, as the ant will advise her.
As she walked along, an ant did crawl into her ear. The girl continued walking, and coming to a
new village heard the ant whisper to her to sit down at the entrance.
As she sat at the gate, some African elders came out in shining clothes and
asked what she was doing there.
Thinking quickly, the girl said she had come to look for a baby, as asking for a rope,
would sound so weak.\n\n

The elders took her to a house, gave her a basket, and told her to collect some corn from the garden.
The ant whispered that she should pull one cob at a time, and arrange it carefully in the basket.
The elders were pleased with her work, and with the cooking that she did on the ant\'s instructions.
Next morning they showed her two babies, one wrapped in red cloth and one in white cloth.\n
She was going to choose the one in the red clothes, when the ant told her to choose the white one instead.
This she did, and the elders gave her the baby, and as many cloths and beads as she could carry.
Then she found her way back to her family and they were overjoyed at her treasures and her baby.
The girl\'s sister was jealous and set off for the heavenly land to seek the same good fortune.
She got up to the sky, but she was a very rude and wilful creature,
who refused to listen to the old woman or heed the warnings of the Ant.
When she saw the babies, she chose the red-clothed one, there was a great explosion
and she fell down dead.\n\n
Her bones dropped on her home from the heavens, and people commented that heaven was angry
with her because she had a wicked heart.\n\n

Tortoise had used up all his salt, and he found his meals so tasteless without it that he decided to
call on his brother and ask him if he had any to spare.
His brother had plenty. \"How will you get it back to your home?\" he asked Tortoise.
If you will wrap the salt in a piece of bark cloth, and tie it up with string, then I can put
the string over my shoulder and drag the parcel along the ground behind me,\" said Tortoise.
A splendid idea!\" exclaimed his brother, and between them they made a tidy package of the salt.
Then Tortoise set off for his long, slow journey home, with the bundle going bump, bump, bump,
along the ground behind him.\n\n

Suddenly he was pulled up short, and turning round, he saw that a large lizard had jumped on to
the parcel of salt and was sitting there, staring at him.
Get off my salt\!" exclaimed Tortoise. \"How do you expect me to drag it home with you on top of it?\"
It\'s not your salt!\' replied the lizard.
\"I was just walking along the path when I found this bundle lying there,
so I took possession of it and now it belongs to me.

What rubbish you talk! You know well it is mine, for I am holding the string that
ties it.But the lizard still insisted that he had found the parcel lying in the road,
and he refused to get off, unless Tortoise went with him to the elders, to have their case tried in court.
Poor Tortoise had to agree, and together they went before the old men at the court.
First Tortoise put his case, explaining that as his arms and legs were so short he
always had to carry bundles by dragging them along behind him.


Then the lizard put his side of the matter, saying that he had found the bundle lying in the road.
"\Surely anything that is picked up on the road belongs to the one who picks it up?\" cried the lizard.
The old men discussed the matter seriously for some time; but many of them were related to the lizard and
thought that they might perhaps get a share of the salt, so eventually they decreed that the bundle
should be cut into two, each animal taking half.
Tortoise was disappointed, because he knew it really was his salt, but he sighed with resignation and
let them divide the parcel.

\n\n The lizard immediately seized the half that was covered with the biggest piece of cloth, leaving poor
Tortoise with most of his salt escaping from his half of the parcel, and spilling out on to the ground.
In vain did Tortoise try to gather his salt together. His hands were too small and there was too little
cloth to wrap round it properly.
Finally he departed for home, with only a fraction of his share, wrapped up in leaves and what
remained of the bark cloth, while the elders scraped up all that had been spilled, dirty though it was, and took it back to their wives.
Tortoise\'s wife was very disappointed when she saw how little salt he had brought with him,
and when he told her the whole story she was most indignant at the way he had been treated.
The long, slow journey had tired him, and he had to rest for several days.

\n\nBut although Tortoise was so slow, he was very cunning and eventually thought up a plan to get even with the lizard
So, after a few days of rest, and saying good-bye to his wife, he plodded along the road towards the lizard\'s home with a gleam in his eye, and after some time he caught sight of the lizard, who was enjoying a solitary meal of flying ants.
Slowly and silently Tortoise came upon him from behind and put his hands on the middle of the lizard\'s
body. "\See what I've found!\" called Tortoise loudly.\"What are you doing?\" asked the perplexed
lizard. \"I was just walking along the path when I found something lying there,\" explained Tortoise.
"\So I picked it up and now it belongs to me, just as you picked up my salt the other day.
When the lizard continued to wriggle and demanded that Tortoise set him free, Tortoise insisted that
they go to the court and get the elders to judge.


\n\nThe old men listened attentively to both sides of the story, and then one said:
"\If we are to be perfectly fair, we must give the same judgment that we gave concerning the salt.
\"Yes,\" said the others, nodding their white heads, \"and we had the bag of salt cut in two.
Therefore we must cut the lizard in two, and Tortoise shall have half.\"That is fair,\" replied Tortoise,
and before the lizard could escape, he seized a knife from an elder's belt and sliced him in half,
and that was the end of the greedy lizard.\"

The San / Bushmen enjoy stories of wizards, witches and witchcraft, as these mystic beings
and their spells play a very real part in their own lives.
There were ten beautiful girls belonging to one family.\n
One day, while they were playing together in the river, the weather being very hot, a strange old man came by.
\'Dip me up some water, pretty girls,\' he croaked, I am very thirsty.
How ugly he is, giggled the girls, \'just like an old frog.\' And they fell about laughing,
all except one, who was ashamed of her sisters\' rudeness.\n\n

Unfortunately for them, the old man was really a magician, and in a twinkling had turned nine of the
girls into tall slender trees, drooping along the river bank.
The polite daughter ran crying to her parents and told them what had happened.
The grief-stricken parents ran to the river bank with a ax, and the father tried to chop the nearest tree down,
but was horrified when blood oozed from the splintered bark.\n
Three times he tried, but each time the blood ran and he had to stop.\n
Sorrowfully, the parents sent their only daughter to live in a faraway land for fear of the
magician, but they themselves dwell in tears beneath the drooping trees forever.\n\n

As with most tribes in Africa, many superstitions has their origins with other people and tribes.
Superstitions spread from one group to the other, and even today, due to the internet, it even spread faster.
Here are a few common superstitions from Southern Africa, and these are generally attributed to
the Hottentot people.\n\n

The incessant chirping of a locust on the roof of one particular hut, meant that a relation had died,
and efforts were made to kill the insect.
Misfortune would also follow if a bird flew into a hut, unless it was speedily killed.
A man who trod on a grave, passed one unmindfully, or pointed at one with his finger, disturbed the
rest of the dead, and had to be punished.\n\n

The hooting of an owl at night, was seen as an omen of death (this differs from the African Bantu belief
which claims that it is up to mischief with some wicked witch or wizard).
When the cattle strayed, the Hottentot would hang his karos (leather cloak) or blanket in the doorway.
When the karos began to swing to and fro it meant that the cattle were on their way back.
A crowing hen (remember cocks crow) would be killed immediately, as it was said to be cursing the
family, and would cause one of the members to die.\n\n

A dog which climbed onto the roof of a hut and dug about or scratched at the sides of the
hut was also killed for the same reason.
An ox or cow which switched its tail in a strange manner, or moved its outstretched tongue from side
to side while lying down, was also regarded as a bad omen. In this case the animal was sometimes spared,
but certainly soon disposed of to someone else!
The Hamerkop bird (see photo) was held in great respect as a bearer of the tidings of death.
Indeed, almost anybody seeing this strange bird at dusk, flitting about with weird activity
along the edge of a marsh or pool while uttering its queer cry, would feel a prickling of the skin! When two or
three are feeding in a small pool they will sometimes execute a singular dance, skipping around one another,
opening and closing their wings and performing strange antics, reminiscent of the three weird witch sisters from Macbeth.
The Hottentots believed that in the same way they can see their reflections mirrored in still water,
a Hammerkop bird can see reflections of the future, and knows who is shortly going to die.\n\n

When the bird sees the image of a person with death overshadowing him, it will fly to the
home of the doomed, and utter its three warning cries. The Hamerkop will watch for the falling
star which prophesies death, as it falls above the area of the dwelling in which someone is about to die.
When it sees this star, it will fly over the abode venting its mournful cries.
When the Hottentots saw the Hamerkop standing in water stirring the mud with its feet and peering into the
swirling water for fish, they said: \'See, the Hamerkop is looking at our reflections to see who will
be the next to die!\' You may be sure they did not stay long to find out!
To ward off enemies, both real and imagined, the head of the house sought out a certain root, on the end of
which he rubbed some fat. He then heated the root in the fire. \n\n

As soon as it began to flame and spit,
he would go to the door and point the flaming root from left to right, pronouncing a magic spell. This
would make the enemy become drowsy and fall asleep, and when he awoke he would lose his way; even if he
had reached his destination, he would be rendered harmless.
When the flame went out the head of the house would put the root back in its place in the hut. It would be
used in the same way if some of the stock strayed at night when jackals or other wild animals were about.
If the women went on a journey during which they had to camp at night in the bush, they took the root with them
as a protection against wild animals.\n\n

Maori created the first man, Mwuetsi, who became the moon.
Maori gave him a ngona horn filled with ngona oil and told him he would live at the bottom of the waters.
Mwuetsi objected and said he wished to live on the land. Maori reluctantly agreed, but said Mwuetsi would give up immortality if he did.
After a while Mwuetsi complained of loneliness, so Maori sent him a woman, Massassi (the morning star), to keep him company for two years.
Each night they slept on opposite sides of a campfire, until one night Mwuetsi jumped over the flame and touched Massassi with a finger he had moistened with the ngona oil.
In the moning Massassi was huge with child, and soon gave birth to plants and trees until the whole earth was covered by them.
At the end of two years Maori took Massassi away.\n\n

Mwuetsi wept for eight years, at which time Maori sent him another woman, Morongo (the evening star), saying that she could stay for two years.
On the first night Mwuetsi touched her with his oiled finger, but she said she was different than Massassi, and that they would have to oil their loins and have intercourse.
This they did, this night, and every night thereafter.\n
Every morning Morongo gave birth to the animals of creation.\n
Then she gave birth to human boys and girls, who became full-grown by that very same evening.\n
Maori voiced his displeasure with a fierce storm, and told Mwuetsi he was hastening his death with all this procreation.
Morongo, ever the temptress, instructed Mwuetsi to build a door to their habitat so that Maori could not see what they were doing.
He did this, and again they slept together.\n\n

Now in the morning Morongo gave birth to violent animals; snakes, scorpions, lions, etc.
With door closed, Morongo and Mwuetsi could not escape from the violent and poisonous creatures.
That was the end of them.\n\n

The Hottentot people of old had a vague notion of an evil spirit, and also knew of ghosts.
They often used a Afrikaans word "toor" which means \'to bewitch\', and spoke of sorcerers,
who were unlike the diviners and witch-doctors, in that they used their powers of the
occult to do harm and not good.\n\n

These sorcerers were nag-lopers (Afrikaans), or night walkers, who carried out their nefariousdeeds in the middle of the night.\n
They were of both sexes, and their constant companions — their familiars — were the owl and the baboon.
It is definitely stated by ethnologists, however, that the Hottentots only came to know of thesecreatures after they had become acquainted with the Bantu.\n
After this, many Hottentots began to copy their superstitions.\n
Night walkers often betrayed themselves by trying to save an owl or baboon from being killed.
They roamed the night with these eerie friends, meeting at an appointed spot, similar as the European witches would meet at their covens.\n\n


They stripped themselves of all clothing and adorned their heads with human finger and toe bones.
A lookout had to be posted at the graves of the newly dead, as the naglopers would try to extractparts of the bodies for their rituals soon after burial.
For this reason, too, stones were often placed on the grave, which also served to prevent dogs or jackals from digging up the corpse.\n\n

At night, night walkers would stealthily approach the huts, carefully walking backwards sothat their footprints pointed away from their destination.\n
The occupants, including the dogs, would fall into a deep sleep, so that the night walkers could carry out their wicked deeds undisturbed.\n\n

Small children were especially attractive to these ghouls, and many became infected with foul diseases.
Adults, too, did not escape their attentions. The women night walkers had their way with the men of the hut, and their male counterparts paid their vile court to the ladies.\n
The sleepers only became aware of this the next morning when they awoke feeling weak and powerless in body and limb. Many a morning after the night before, must have been blamed on a convenient night walker!
It was chiefly to Bantu witchdoctors that the Hottentots turned for an antidote to these
doleful occurrences.\n\n

The cure usually entailed cuts on the skin into which a medicine was rubbed. This caused such
an itching and burning whenever a night walker approached that the sleeper was bound to awake before he was molested.
One of the ways to catch a sorcerer was to place a doctored curry at the entrance of the hut.\n
Should a night walker try to enter, and step over the curry, it will hold him and he would
remain stuck until sunrise the next morning.\n
The first person to awake and see him there must remain quite quiet. He must shake the other
sleepers very gently without calling them by name; by this they would know all was not well.
The first to speak to the intruder would be the head of the kraal, who was immediately summoned,
and this would free the night walker. The punishment was then decided on,
and usually painfully carried out.\n\n

It was considered dangerous to stand in anyone shadow as he might have some magic medicine in
his body which could be harmful.\n
Because of this, some Hottentots developed the habit of rising early, when no shadows were yet cast by the sun.
In this way, people were supposed to rid themselves of anything harmful whichthey might have picked up the previous evening,
and could transmit to others, if they rose after the sun was high.\n\n

Long ago a man and a woman came down from heaven, while another man and woman came out of the ground.
The \'Lord of the Heavens\' also sent a African python, (a non-poisonous snake of Africa), which made its home in a river.
In the beginning men and women had no children; they had no desire for one another and did not
know the process of procreation and birth.\n
It was the Python who taught them. He asked the men and women if they had any children,
and on being told that they had none, the Python said he would make the women conceive.
He told the couples to stand facing each other, and then he went into the river and came out
with his mouth full of water.\n\n

This he sprayed on their bellies, saying \"Kus, kus\" (words that are still used in today
in the clan rituals)n
Then the Python told the couples to go home and lie together, and the women conceived and bore children.
The children and descendents took the Python ("'spirit of the river'"), as their \'Clan Spirit\'.\n
Killing or harming a python as taboo, and if they find a python that has died or been killed
by someone else, they put white clay on it and bury it human fashion.\n\n

Folktales and origin stories from Zimbabwe in Southern Africa
Modimo was the creator. He distributed good things, appeared in the east and belonged to the element water.\n
At the same time he was a destroyer, a terrifying creature responsible for drought, hail, cyclones and earthquakes.
When these things happened, he appeared in the west and was part of the element fire.
Modimo was also sky and light, earth and root. He was unique and singular.\n
He had no ancestors, no past or future. He pervaded the whole of creation.\n
His name was taboo and could be spoken only by priests and seers.\n\n

There was once a African girl named Marwe. She and her brother were responsible for keeping the
monkeys from raiding the family bean fields.\n
One day, after they have been faithfully keeping the monkeys away, they both became very thirsty.
They turned their backs on the fields, and went to a pool to take a drink of water.\n
When they returned to the fields, the monkeys had eaten all the beans.\n
Marwe was so scared of the wrath of her parents, that she drowned herself.\n
Her brother rushed home with the terrible news of her suicide.\n
Her parents were so shocked and grieved on hearing the terrible news,
that they forgot about the bean field.\n\n

Marwe sank to the bottom of the pool until she entered the land of the dead.
She first came to a house where an old woman lived with her children.
The old woman identified herself as Marwe\'s guide in the land of the dead.
For many years Marwe lived with the old woman and helped with the chores.
After a time Marwe became very homesick and began to think of her parents and brother.
The old woman was able to read the girl\'s heart, and she knew that Marwe wished to rejoin the living.
So one day the old woman asked Marwe if she preferred the hot or the cold.
Marwe didn\'t understand and the woman repeated the question.\n\n

Finally Marwe answered that she preferred the cold, not knowing what this meant.
The old woman had Marwe dip her hands into a clay jar of cold water,
and when she pulled her hands out, they were covered with jewels.
She put her feet and legs into the jar, pulled them out, and they too were covered with jewels.
Smiling, the old woman dressed Marwe in the finest robes and sent her home.
The old woman also had the gift of prophecy, and told Marwe that she would soon marry the finest man in the world,
a man named Sawoye.\n\n

When Marwe arrived home in her fine robes and jewels, her family was overjoyed.
They had given her up for dead long before. They marvelled at her fine clothing and their newfound wealth.
Word spread quickly through the countryside, that there was a rich,
eligible young woman in the territory, and Marwe\'s home was visited by hundreds of suitors.
Marwe ignored all of the men, including the most handsome of them all, except for a man named Sawoye.
He suffered from a terrible skin disease that made him look ugly.
But, having been to the land of the dead, Marwe was able to read the hearts of men,
and knew that Sawoye was the best of all the men.\n\n

Sawoye and Marwe were married with great feasting, and after their wedding night, when the marriage was consummated,
Sawoye\'s skin disease disappeared, showing his face to be the most handsome of all.
As Marwe had plenty of fine jewels to spare, they bought a herd of cattle.
Soon Marwe and Sawoye were the wealthiest people in the land.
One might expect that they would now live in happiness,
but the many suitors of Marwe were envious of Sawoye.\n
All of their friends and neighbours changed, resenting the wealthy young couple.\n\n

The hostility grew more bitter with each day, until a group of neighbours attacked Sawoye and killed him.
But Marwe had herself already died, and knew the secrets of the Underworld,
including how to revive the dead.
She took her husband\'s body inside their home and recited magic incantations that she
had learned from the old woman in the land of the dead.\n\n

Sawoye revived, stronger than ever. When their enemies returned to divide up the wealth,
Sawoye slew them all.\n
Marwe and Sawoye lived in prosperity and happiness for the rest of their lives, and since both had died,
they met their final ends without fear\n\n

There was a Shepherd Boy who tended his sheep at the foot of a mountain near a dark forest.
It was lonely for him, so he devised a plan to get a little company.\n
He rushed down towards the village calling out \“Wolf, Wolf,\” and the villagers came out to meet him.
This pleased the boy so much that a few days after he tried the same trick,
and again the villagers came to his help.\n
Shortly after this a Wolf actually did come out from the forest. The boy cried out \“Wolf,
Wolf,\” still louder than before.\n
But this time the villagers, who had been fooled twice before,
thought the boy was again lying, and nobody came to his aid.\n
So the Wolf made a good meal off the boy’s flock.\n\n

The hare is a favourite villain in many African stories and in this one he encounters that strange animal, the inkalimeva.
One day the animals made a kraal and inside it they hid their most precious possession, a large pot of fat.
They told the rock rabbit, or dassie, that he must stand guard, and off they went.
By and by, who should come along, but the inkalimeva.\n
The dassie, who was a lazy little creature, had already fallen asleep,
so the inkalimeva went in and ate up all the fat.\n
As he went out, he flicked a pebble at the dassie and woke him up.\n\n

The dassie started up crying, \'The fat belonging to all the animals has been eaten by the inkalimeva!
The animals rushed up and were so angry about loosingtheir fat, that they killed the dassie.\n
When they had accumulated more fat, they set the muishond, or skunk, to guard the gate.
This time the inkalimeva brought with him a pot of honey (which the muishond loves!),
and while the foolish guard was licking and guzzling the honey,
the inkalimeva slipped in and devoured all the fat. Then he threw a stone at the
muishond which made it look up.\n\n

The muishond gave a cry of horror. The fat belonging to all the animals had been eaten by the inkalimeva!
Again the animals were very angry at loosing their precious fat,
and the unfortunate muishond was soon beaten to death.
In vain the animals set new guards — the duiker, the blue buck, and the porcupine.
Each in turn was outwitted by the inkalimeva.\n
At last they chose the hare to be guard. \'Oh no,\' said the hare, \'the dassie is dead,
the muishond is dead, the blue buck is dead, the duiker is dead, and so is the porcupine.
Do you think I am tired of life?\'
They continued to coax and promise him that they would not kill him, and so he agreed.
When the animals had gone, he lay down, but only pretended to be asleep. Soon,
up crept the inkalimeva and into the kraal he went, and started to lick the fat.
Hi! shouted the hare, Leave the fat alone.\n
The inkalimeva realized that he should make friends with this wakeful fellow and in a little while,
they were chatting and playing games.\n\n
You could tie my tail to anything and I could always escape, boasted the hare.
You could do that with mine too, I have a fine tail, responded the inkalimeva.
Let us see then, said the hare. The inkalimeva agreed, and in a moment the hare had tied him fast.
Inkalimeva and the Hare (African myths, fables and stories.)
When he saw the inkalimeva could not escape, the hare took his club and killed him.
He then took the inkalimeva\'s tail, which was delicious, and ate it all,
except for a little bit which he could not manage.
This he hid in the kraal fence.\n\n

Then he called loudly: \'The fat belonging to the animals has been eaten by the inkalimeva.
The anxious animals came running, but how relieved they were when they saw the fat safe and the inkalimeva lying dead.
They asked the hare for the tail, which by rights belonged to the chief.\n
The hare replied, The one I killed did not have any tail.\n\n

How can there be an inkalimeva without a tail? they said in disbelief.
They began to search and at length found the piece of tail in the fence.
When the chief heard that the hare had eaten his royal portion he was very angry. \'Bring him to me, he ordered.
\'So that I could punish him!
But by this time the hare was long gone!\n\n

\nOnce upon a time there lived a wise man by the name of Mamad. He never lied. All the people in the land, even the ones who lived twenty days away, knew about him.

\n\nThe king heard about Mamad and ordered his subjects to bring him to the palace. He looked at the wise man and asked:

\n\n\"Mamad, is it true, that you have never lied?\"

\n\n\" It\'s true.\"

\n\n\"And you will never lie in your life?\"

\n\n\" I\'m sure in that.\"

\n\n\"Okay, tell the truth, but be careful! The lie is cunning and it gets on your tongue easily.\"

\n\nSeveral days passed and the king called Mamad once again.
There was a big crowd: the king was about to go hunting.
The king held his horse by the mane, his left foot was already on the stirrup. He ordered Mamad:

\n\n\"Go to my summer palace and tell the queen I will be with her for lunch.
Tell her to prepare a big feast. You will have lunch with me then.\"

\n\nMamad bowed down and went to the queen. Then the king laughed and said:

\n\n\"We won\'t go hunting and now Mamad will lie to the queen. Tomorrow we will laugh on his behalf.\"

\n\nBut the wise Mamad went to the palace and said:

\n\n\"Maybe you should prepare a big feast for lunch tomorrow, and maybe you shouldn\'t.
Maybe the king will come by noon, and maybe he won\'t.\"

\n\n\"Tell me will he come, or won\'t he?\" - asked the queen.

\n\n\"I don\'t know weather he put his right foot on the stirrup, or he put his left foot on the ground after I left.\"

\n\nEverybody waited for the king. He came the next day and said to the queen:

\n\n\"The wise Mamad, who never lies, lied to you yesterday.\"

\n\nBut the queen told him about the words of Mamad.
And the king realized, that the wise man never lies, and says only that, which he saw with his own eyes.

\“Once upon a time,\” began Outa Karel, and his audience of three looked up expectantly.

\n\n\“Once upon a time, Oom Leeuw roared and the forest shook with the dreadful sound.
Then, from far away over the vlakte, floated another roar,
and the little lion cubs jumped about and stood on their heads, tumbling over each other in their merriment.

\n\n\“\‘Hear,\’ they said, \‘it is Volstruis, old Three Sticks.
He tries to imitate the King, our father. He roars well. Truly there is no difference.’

\n\n\“When Leeuw heard this he was very angry, so he roared again, louder than ever.
Again came back the sound over the veld, as if it had been an echo.

\n\n\“\‘Ach, no! this will never do,\’ thought Leeuw.
\‘I must put a stop to this impudence.
I alone am King here, and imitators—I want none.\’

\n\n\“So he went forth and roamed over the vlakte till he met old Three Sticks, the Ostrich. They stood glaring at each other.

\n\n\“Leeuw\’s eyes flamed, his mane rose in a huge mass and he lashed his tail angrily.
Volstruis spread out his beautiful wings and swayed from side to side, his beak open and his neck twisting like a whip-snake.
Ach! it was pretty, but if baasjes could have seen his eyes! Baasjes know, Volstruis\’s
eyes are very soft and beautiful—like Nonnie\’s when she tells the Bible stories;
but now there was only fierceness in them, and yellow lights that looked like fire.

\n\n\“But there was no fight—yet.
It was only their way of meeting.
Leeuw came a step nearer and said, \‘We must see who is baas.
You, Volstruis, please to roar a little.\’

\n\n\“So Volstruis roared, blowing out his throat, so, \‘Hoo-hoo-hoor-r-r-r!\’
It was a fearsome sound—the sort of sound that makes you feel streams of cold water
running down your back when you hear it suddenly and don\’t know what it is.
Yes, baasjes, if you are in bed you curl up and pull the blankets over your head,
and if you are outside you run in and get close to the Nooi or Nonnie.\”

\n\nA slight movement, indicative of contradiction,
passed from one to another of his small hearers, but—unless it was a free and easy,
conversational evening—they made it a point of honour never to interrupt Outa in full career.
This, like other things, could await the finish of the story.

\n\n\“Then Leeuw roared, and truly the voices were the same.
No one could say, \‘This is a bigger voice,\’ or \‘That is a more terrifying voice.\’ No, they were just equal.

\n\n\“So Leeuw said to Volstruis, \‘Our voices are alike.
You are my equal in roaring.
Let it then be so.
You will be King of the Birds as I am King of the Beasts.
Now let us go hunting and see who is baas there.’

\n\n\“Out in the vlakte some sassaby were feeding,
big fat ones, a nice klompje; so Leeuw started off in one direction and Volstruis in the other,
but both kept away from the side the wind came from.
Wild bucks can smell—ach toch! so good.
Just one little puff when a hunter is creeping up to them,
and at once all the heads are in the air—sniff, sniff, sniff—and they are off like the wind.
Dust is all you see, and when that has blown away—ach no! there are no bucks; the whole veld is empty, empty!\”

\n\nOuta stretched out his arms and waved them from side to side with an exaggerated expression of
finding nothing but empty space, his voice mournful with a sense of irreparable loss.

\n\n\“But\”—he took up his tale with renewed energy—\“Leeuw and Volstruis were old hunters.
They knew how to get nearer and nearer without letting the bucks know.
Leeuw trailed himself along slowly, slowly,
close to the ground, and only when he was moving could you see which was Leeuw and which was sand: the colour was just the same.

\n\n\“He picked out a big buck, well-grown and fat, but not too old to be juicy,
and when he got near enough he hunched himself up very quietly—so, my little masters,
just so—ready to spring, and then before you could whistle,
he shot through the air like a stone from a catapult, and fell, fair and square, on to the sassaby\’s back,
his great tearing claws fastened on its shoulders and his wicked teeth meeting in the poor thing’s neck.

\n\n\“Ach! the beautiful big buck! Never again would his pointed horns tear open his enemies! Never again would he lead the herd,
or pronk in the veld in mating time! Never again would his soft nostrils scent danger in the distance,
nor his quick hoofs give the signal for the stampede!
No, it was really all up with him this time! When Oom Leeuw gets hold of a thing, he doesn’t let go till it is dead.

\n\n\“The rest of the herd—ach, but they ran! Soon they were far away, only specks in the distance;
all except those that Volstruis had killed.
Truly Volstruis was clever! Baasjes know, he can run fast—faster even than the sassaby.
So when he saw Leeuw getting ready to spring, he raced up-wind as hard as he could, knowing that was what the herd would do.
So there he was waiting for them, and didn\’t he play with them! See, baasjes,
he stood just so\”—in his excitement Outa rose and struck an attitude—\“and when they streaked past him he jumped like this,
striking at them with the hard, sharp claws on his old two toes.\” Outa hopped about like a fighting bantam,
while the children hugged themselves in silent delight.

\n\n\“Voerts! there was one dead!\”—Outa kicked to the right.
\“Voerts! there was another!\”—he kicked to the left—\“till there was a klomp of bucks lying about the veld giving their last blare.
Yes, old Two Toes did his work well that day.

\n\n\“When Leeuw came up and saw that Volstruis had killed more than he had, he was not very pleased, but Volstruis soon made it all right.

\n\n\“Leeuw said, \‘You have killed most, so you rip open and begin to eat.\’

\n\n\“\‘Oh no!\’ said Volstruis, \‘you have cubs to share the food with, so you rip open and eat. I shall only drink the blood.\’

\n\n\“This put Leeuw in a good humour; he thought Volstruis a noble, unselfish creature.
But truly, as I said before, Volstruis was clever.
Baasjes see, he couldn\’t eat meat; he had no teeth. But he didn\’t want Leeuw to know.
Therefore he said, \‘You eat; I will only drink the blood.\’

\n\n\“So Leeuw ripped open—sk-r-r-r-r, sk-r-r-r-r—and called the cubs,
and they all ate till they were satisfied.
Then Volstruis came along in a careless fashion, pecking, pecking as he walked,
and drank the blood. Then he and Leeuw lay down in the shade of some trees and went to sleep.

\n\n\“The cubs played about, rolling and tumbling over each other.
As they played they came to the place where Volstruis lay.

\n\n\“\‘Aha!\’ said one, \‘he sleeps with his mouth open.\’

\n\n\“He peeped into Volstruis\’s mouth. \‘Aha!\’ he said again, \‘I see something.\’

\n\n\“Another cub came and peeped.

\n\n\“\‘Alle kracht!\’ he said, \‘I see something too. Let us go and tell our father.\’

\n\n\“So they ran off in great excitement and woke Leeuw. \‘Come, come quickly,\’ they said.
\‘Volstruis insults you by saying he is your equal.
He lies sleeping under the trees with his mouth wide open, and we have peeped into it,
and behold, he has no teeth! Come and see for yourself.\’

\n\n\“Leeuw bounded off quick-quick with the cubs at his tail.

\n\n\“\‘Nier-r-r-r,\’ he growled, waking Volstruis, \‘nier-r-r-r. What is the meaning of this? You pretend you are my equal,
and you haven\’t even got teeth.\’

\n\n\“\‘Teeth or no teeth,\’ said Volstruis, standing up wide awake, \‘I killed more bucks than you did to-day.
Teeth or no teeth, I\’ll fight you to show who’s baas.’

\n\n“‘Come on,’ said Leeuw. ‘Who’s afraid? I’m just ready for you. Come on!’

\n\n“‘No, wait a little,’ said Volstruis. ‘I’ve got a plan. You see that ant-heap over there? Well, you stand on one side of it, and I’ll stand on the other side, and we’ll see who can push it over first. After that we’ll come out into the open and fight.’

\n\n“‘That seems an all-right plan,’ said Leeuw; and he thought to himself, ‘I’m heavier and stronger; I can easily send the ant-heap flying on to old Three Sticks, and then spring over and kill him.’

\n\n“But wait a bit! It was not as easy as he thought. Every time he sprang at the ant-heap he clung to it as he was accustomed to cling to his prey. He had no other way of doing things. And then Volstruis would take the opportunity of kicking high into the air, sending the sand and stones into Leeuw’s face, and making him howl and splutter with rage.

\n\n“Sometimes he would stand still and roar, and Volstruis would send a roar back from the other side.

\n\n“So they went on till the top of the ant-heap was quite loosened by the kicks and blows. Leeuw was getting angrier and angrier, and he could hardly see—his eyes were so full of dust. He gathered himself together for a tremendous spring, but, before he could make it, Volstruis bounded into the air and kicked the whole top off the ant-heap. Arré, but the dust was thick!

\n\n“When it cleared away, there lay Leeuw, groaning and coughing, with the great heap of earth and stones on top of him.

\n\n“‘Ohé! ohé!’ wailed the cubs, ‘get up, my father. Here he comes, the Toothless One! He who has teeth only on his feet! Get up and slay him.’

\n\n“Leeuw shook himself free of the earth and sprang at Volstruis, but his eyes were full of sand; he could not see properly, so he missed. As he came down heavily, Volstruis shot out his strong right leg and caught Leeuw in the side. Sk-r-r-r-r! went the skin, and goops! goops! over fell poor Oom Leeuw, with Volstruis’s terrible claws—the teeth of old Two Toes—fastened into him.

\n\n“Volstruis danced on him, flapping and waving his beautiful black and white wings, and tearing the life out of Oom Leeuw.

\n\n“When it was all over, he cleaned his claws in the sand and waltzed away slowly over the veld to where his mate sat on the nest.

\n\n“Only the cubs were left wailing over the dead King of the Forest.”

\n\nThe usual babel of question and comment broke out at the close of the story, till at last Pietie’s decided young voice detached itself from the general chatter.

\n\n“Outa, what made you say that about pulling the blankets over one’s head and running to get near Mammie if one heard Volstruis bellowing at night? You know quite well that none of us would ever do it.”

\n\n“Yes, yes, my baasje, I know,” said Outa, soothingly. “I never meant anyone who belongs to the land of Volstruise. But other little masters, who did not know the voice of old Three Sticks—they would run to their mam-mas if they heard him.”

\n\n“Oh, I see,” said Pietie, accepting the apology graciously. “I was sure you could not mean a karroo farm boy.”

\n\n“Is your story a parable, Outa?” asked little Jan, who had been doing some hard thinking for the last minute.

\n\n“Ach! and what is that, my little master?”

\n\n“A kind of fable, Outa.”

\n\n“Yes, that’s what it is, baasje,” said Outa, gladly seizing on the word he understood, “a fable, a sort of nice little fable.”

\n\n“But a parable is an earthly story with a heavenly meaning, and when Cousin Minnie tells us parables she always finds the meaning for us. What is the heavenly meaning of this, Outa?”

\n\nLittle Jan’s innocent grey eyes were earnestly fixed on Outa’s face, as though to read from it the explanation he sought. For once the old native was nonplussed. He rubbed his red kopdoek, laid a crooked finger thoughtfully against his flat nose, scratched his sides, monkey-fashion, and finally had recourse once more to the kopdoek. But all these expedients failed to inspire him with the heavenly meaning of the story he had just told. Ach! these dear little ones, to think of such strange things! There they all were, waiting for his next words. He must get out of it somehow.

\n\n“Baasjes,” he began, smoothly, “there is a beautiful meaning to the story, but Outa hasn’t got time to tell it now. Another time——”

\n\n“Outa,” broke in Willem, reprovingly, “you know you only want to get away so that you can go to the old tramp-floor, where the volk are dancing to-night.”

\n\n“No, my baasje, truly no!”

\n\n“And I wouldn’t be surprised to hear that you had danced, too, after the way you have been jumping about here.”

\n\n“Yes, that was fine,” said Pietie, with relish. “‘Voerts! there is one dead! Voerts! there is another!’ Outa, you always say you are so stiff, but you can still kick well.”

\n\n“Aja, baasje,” returned Outa, modestly; “in my day I was a great dancer. No one could do the Vastrap better—and the Hondekrap—and the Valsrivier. Arré, those were the times!”

\n\n He gave a little hop at the remembrance of those mad and merry days, and yet another and another, always towards the passage leading to the kitchen.

\n\n“But the meaning, Outa, the heavenly meaning!” cried little Jan. “You haven’t told us.”

\n\n“No, my little baas, not to-night. Ask the Nonnie; she will tell you. Here she comes.”

And as Cousin Minnie entered the room, the wily old native, with an agility not to be expected from his cramped and crooked limbs, skipped away, leaving her to bear the brunt of his inability to explain his own story.

Effiong Edem was a native of Cobham Town.
He had a very fine daughter, whose name was Afiong.
All the young men in the country wanted to marry her on account of her beauty;
but she refused all offers of marriage in spite of repeated entreaties from her parents,
as she was very vain, and said she would only marry the best-looking man in the country,
who would have to be young and strong, and capable of loving her properly.
Most of the men her parents wanted her to marry, although they were rich, were old men and ugly,
so the girl continued to disobey her parents, at which they were very much grieved.
The skull who lived in the spirit land heard of the beauty of this Calabar virgin,
and thought he would like to possess her; so he went about amongst his friends and borrowed different parts of the body from them,
all of the best.
From one he got a good head, another lent him a body, a third gave him strong arms,
and a fourth lent him a fine pair of legs.
\n\nAt last he was complete, and was a very perfect specimen of manhood.

\n\nHe then left the spirit land and went to Cobham market, where he saw Afiong, and admired her very much.

About this time Afiong heard that a very fine man had been seen in the market,
who was better-looking than any of the natives.
She therefore went to the market at once,
and directly she saw the Skull in his borrowed beauty,
she fell in love with him, and invited him to her house.
The Skull was delighted, and went home with her,
and on his arrival was introduced by the girl to her parents,
and immediately asked their consent to marry their daughter.
\n\nAt first they refused, as they did not wish her to marry a stranger, but at last they agreed.

He lived with Afiong for two days in her parents\' house,
and then said he wished to take his wife back to his country, which was far off.
To this the girl readily agreed, as he was such a fine man,
but her parents tried to persuade her not to go.
However, being very headstrong, she made up her mind to go, and they started off together.
After they had been gone a few days the father consulted his Ju Ju man,
who by casting lots very soon discovered that his daughter\'s husband belonged to the spirit land, and that she would surely be killed.
\n\nThey therefore all mourned her as dead.

After walking for several days,
Afiong and the Skull crossed the border between the spirit land and the human country.
Directly they set foot in the spirit land, first of all one man came to the Skull and demanded his legs,
then another his head, and the next his body, and so on, until in a few minutes the skull was left by itself in all its natural ugliness.
At this the girl was very frightened, and wanted to return home, but the skull would not allow this, and ordered her to go with him.
When they arrived at the skull\'s house they found his mother, who was a very old woman quite incapable of doing any work,
who could only creep about.
Afiong tried her best to help her, and cooked her food, and brought water and firewood for the old woman.
\n\nThe old creature was very grateful for these attentions, and soon became quite fond of Afiong.

One day the old woman told Afiong that she was very sorry for her, but all the people in the spirit land were cannibals,
and when they heard there was a human being in their country, they would come down and kill her and eat her.
The skull\'s mother then hid Afiong, and as she had looked after her so well,
she promised she would send her back to her country as soon as possible,
providing that she promised for the future to obey her parents.
This Afiong readily consented to do.\n
Then the old woman sent for the spider,
who was a very clever hairdresser, and made him dress Afiong\'s hair in the latest fashion.
She also presented her with anklets and other things on account of her kindness.
She then made a Ju Ju and called the winds to come and convey Afiong to her home.
At first a violent tornado came, with thunder, lightning and rain, but the skull\'s mother sent him away as unsuitable.
The next wind to come was a gentle breeze, so she told the breeze to carry Afiong to her mother\'s house, and said good-bye to her.
\n\nVery soon afterwards the breeze deposited Afiong outside her home, and left her there.

When the parents saw their daughter they were very glad, as they had for some months given her up as lost.
The father spread soft animals\' skins on the ground from where his daughter was standing all the way to the house,
so that her feet should not be soiled.
Afiong then walked to the house, and her father called all the young girls who belonged to Afiong\'s company to come and dance,
and the feasting and dancing was kept up for eight days and nights.
When the rejoicing was over, the father reported what had happened to the head chief of the town.
The chief then passed a law that parents should never allow their daughters to marry strangers who came from a far country.
Then the father told his daughter to marry a friend of his, and she willingly consented,
\n\nand lived with him for many years, and had many children.

Folk Stories from Southern Nigeria

        <item>

There was once an old woman who was very poor,
and lived in a small mud hut thatched with mats made from the leaves of the tombo palm in the bush.
\n\nShe was often very hungry, as there was no one to look after her.

In the olden days the moon used often to come down to the earth, although she lived most of the time in the sky.
The moon was a fat woman with a skin of hide, and she was full of fat meat. She was quite round
, and in the night used to give plenty of light.\n\n

The moon was sorry for the poor starving old woman,
so she came to her and said, \"You may cut some of my meat away for your food.\"
This the old woman did every evening, and the moon got smaller and smaller until you could scarcely see her at all.
Of course this made her give very little light, and all the people began to grumble in consequence,
\n\nand to ask why it was that the moon was getting so thin.

At last the people went to the old woman\'s house where there happened to be a little girl sleeping.
She had been there for some little time, and had seen the moon come down every evening,
and the old woman go out with her knife and carve her daily supply of meat out of the moon.
\n\nAs she was very frightened, she told the people all about it, so they determined to set a watch on the movements of the old woman.

That very night the moon came down as usual,
and the old woman went out with her knife and basket to get her food;
but before she could carve any meat all the people rushed out shouting,
and the moon was so frightened that she went back again into the sky, and never came down again to the earth.
\n\nThe old woman was left to starve in the bush.

Ever since that time the moon has hidden herself most of the day, as she was so frightened,
and she still gets very thin once a month,
but later on she gets fat again, and when she is quite fat she gives plenty of light all the night;
but this does not last very long, and she begins to get thinner and thinner,
\n\nin the same way as she did when the old woman was carving her meat from her.

In the olden days there were no hooks or casting nets,
\n\nso that when the natives wanted to catch fish they made baskets and set traps at the river side.

\n\nOne man named Akon Obo, who was very poor, began to make baskets and traps out of bamboo palm,
and then when the river went down he used to take his traps to a pool and set them baited with palm-nuts.
In the night the big fish used to smell the palm-nuts and go into the trap,
when at once the door would fall down,
and in the morning Akon Obo would go and take the fish out. He was very successful in his fishing,
and used to sell the fish in the market for plenty of money.
When he could afford to pay the dowry he married a woman named Eyong, a native of Okuni,
and had three children by her, but he still continued his fishing.
The eldest son was called Odey, the second Yambi, and the third Atuk.
These three boys, when they grew up, helped their father with his fishing, and he gradually became wealthy and bought plenty of slaves.
At last he joined the Egbo society, and became one of the chiefs of the town.
Even after he became a chief, he and his sons still continued to fish.

\n\nOne day, when he was crossing the river in a small dug-out canoe, a tornado came on very suddenly, and the canoe capsized,
drowning the chief.
When his sons heard of the death of their father, they wanted to go and drown themselves also, but they were persuaded not to by the people.
After searching for two days, they found the dead body some distance down the river, and brought it back to the town.
They then called their company together to play, dance, and sing for twelve days, in accordance with their native custom,
and much palm wine was drunk.

\n\nWhen the play was finished, they took their father\'s body to a hollowed-out cavern, and placed two live slaves with it,
one holding a native lamp of palm-oil, and the other holding a matchet.
They were both tied up, so that they could not escape, and were left there to keep watch over the dead chief, until they died of starvation.

\n\nWhen the cave was covered in, the sons called the chiefs together, and they played Egbo for seven days,
which used up a lot of their late father\'s money.
When the play was over, the chiefs were surprised at
the amount of money which the sons had been able to spend on the funeral of their father,
as they knew how poor he had been as a young man. They therefore called him the lucky fisherman.

\“Kwasuka sukela….\”

\n\nLong ago a wicked and lazy hunter was sitting under a tree.
He was thinking that it was too hot to be bothered with the arduous task of stalking prey through the bushes.
Below him in the clearing on the grassy veld there were fat springbok grazing.
But this hunter couldn\’t be bothered, so lazy was he! He gazed at the herd,
wishing that he could have the meat without the work, when suddenly he noticed a movement off to the left of the buck.
It was a female cheetah seeking food.
Keeping downwind of the herd, she moved closer and closer to them.
She singled out a springbok who had foolishly wandered away from the rest.
Suddenly she gathered her long legs under her and sprang forward.
With great speed she came upon the springbok and brought it down.
Startled, the rest of the herd raced away as the cheetah quickly killed her prey.

\n\nThe hunter watched as the cheetah dragged her prize to some shade on the edge of the clearing.
There three beautiful cheetah cubs were waiting there for her.
The lazy hunter was filled with envy for the cubs and wished that he could have such a good hunter provide for him.
Imagine dining on delicious meat every day without having to do the actual hunting! Then he had a wicked idea.
He decided that he would steal one of the cheetah cubs and train it to hunt for him.
He decided to wait until the mother cheetah went to the waterhole late in the afternoon to make his move.
He smiled to himself.

\n\nWhen the sun began to set, the cheetah left her cubs concealed in a bush and set off to the waterhole.
Quickly the hunter grabbed his spear and trotted down to the bushes where the cubs were hidden.
There he found the three cubs, still to young to be frightened of him or to run away.
He first chose one, then decided upon another, and then changed his mind again.
Finally he stole them all, thinking to himself that three cheetahs would undoubtedly be better than one.

When their mother returned half-an-hour later and found her babies gone, she was broken-hearted.
The poor mother cheetah cried and cried until her tears made dark stains down her cheeks.
She wept all night and into the next day.
She cried so loudly that she was heard by an old man who came to see what the noise was all about.

\n\nNow this old man was wise and knew the ways of the animals.
When he discovered what the wicked hunter had done, he became very angry.
The lazy hunter was not only a thief, he had broken the traditions of the tribe.
Everyone knew that a hunter must use only his own strength and skill.
Any other way of hunting was surely a dishonour.

\n\nThe old man returned to the village and told the elders what has happened.
The villagers became angry.
They found the lazy hunter and drove him away from the village.
The old man took the three cheetah cubs back to their grateful mother.
But the long weeping of the mother cheetah stained her face forever.
Today the cheetah wears the tearstains on its face as a reminder to the
hunters that it is not honourable to hunt in any other way than that which is traditional.

Gogo breathed deeply of the cool evening air. She paused beneath the darkening sky, hands pressed into her back.

\n\n\“Woza, Gogo!\” called little Methembe, who, although he seemed to have unlimited energy, always waited for his granny.
\“Come on!\” he encouraged as he turned and dashed up the final rise toward the homestead.
Gogo chuckled, shook her head slowly and forced her feet to continue up the path.
\“Hawu!\” she thought to herself.
Soon she would no longer be able to make it down to the river and back.
By the time Gogo came within sight of the evening fire,
the children had put away the washed clothing and deposited the firewood where it was stored.
They were now squatting in a tight circle, the older ones rocking on their heels,
waiting for their elders to finish eating that they might then have their dinner.

\n\nAfter everyone had eaten and the pots were filled with water to soak, Gogo and the children settled down before the fire.
\“Gogo,\” asked Methembe rather tentatively, choosing to look into the fire rather than at his beloved granny,
\“why do people grow old and die?\” The old woman looked lovingly at her grandson and smiled.
She knew his unspoken fears.

\n\n\“Ahh, my little Hope,\” she answered, looking into the fire herself.
\“That is a very interesting tale! Shall I tell you, my children, the story of why people must grow old and die?\”

\n\n\“Yebo, Gogo! Yes!\” they all answered as if one.

\n\n\“Alright then…\” And Gogo began.
\“Kwasuka sukela….\”

\n\nAfter God the great Creator finished making all things,
he sat back and took a long look at the world he\’d made.
He smiled and decided that it was very good.
He was especially pleased with the people, the first man and woman.
They, after all, were the most like himself.
\“Yes,\” he thought, \“this is good! Very good!\”

\n\nBut as time went on the Creator noticed that man and woman kept injuring their bodies.
Oh, the skin would heal with time, but it always left scars.
And after many years the first man and woman’s bodies were looking old and tatty indeed! \“Hmmm,\” thought Creator,
\“these bodies are wearing out! Time, I think, for new ones!\”

\n\nSo Creator called Chameleon to himself.
\“Listen, Chameleon,\” said Creator, \“I have a package that I want you to deliver to man and woman.
It is most urgent, so do not delay.
Go straight to the people, tell them I sent you, and give them this parcel from me!\”
With that he pushed a small package into Chameleon\’s hands.
\“I trust you, Chameleon, for you are loyal and swift. Go now!\”

\n\nSo Chameleon set off to do as his Lord bid.
In those days Chameleon was fast as lightning.
He sped toward Earth, the parcel neatly tucked beneath his arm.
When he reached the great river he paused to take a drink.
And this proved to be his undoing!

\n\nSnake just happened to be drinking at the same time.
\“Hello, Cousin Chameleon,\” he hissed.
\“My, you are in a great hurry today! What are you about?\”

\n\nChameleon looked up.
\“Ah, yebo! Sawubona, Nyoka!\” he politely replied.
(sah-woo-boh\’-nah nyoh’kah = \“Yes, I see you, Snake!
\” or \“Hello, Snake!\”) \“I have a package to deliver for Creator. Something for the people.\”

\n\nNow Snake hated the people.
They walked so far above the ground, often treading on Snake and his family members without even noticing.
And Creator seemed to pay so much more attention to them than he did to the other animals.
Snake was bitterly jealous of people, and when he heard that Chameleon was taking a gift to them from Creator, Snake began to scheme.
How could he make sure that people did not receive this gift?

\n\n\“Oh, dear Cousin Chameleon,\” Snake hissed, edging closer to Chameleon and the parcel.
\“It is so good to see you again! My family has missed you a great deal! All of our other relatives come often to share a meal.
But you never seem to have time for us! One would tend to think that perhaps you thought yourself too good to associate with your close kin!\”

\n\nNow Chameleon was a sensitive fellow.
It worried him to think that Snake might have something against him.
\“Oh, no, dear cousin Nyoka,\” pleaded Chameleon.
\“I assure you that I hold you in high regard! I would be honoured to come for a meal sometime!\”

\n\n\“Well,\” Snake answered quickly, \“why not now? My wife is at this very moment waiting lunch for me.
She would be pleased beyond words to see you dine with us!\”

\n\n\“Oh, dear!\” answered Chameleon, looking at the parcel still tucked beneath his arm.
\“I really have an urgent errand for Creator at the moment.
Ummmm….
perhaps some other time?\”

\n\n\“Yes, yes,\” hissed Snake turning away with a hint of disgust in his voice.
\“Just as I thought. Too good for the likes of us! Well, run along then with your all-important business.\”

\n\nChameleon looked at the sun. It was still high in the sky.
He could have the mid-day meal with Snake\’s family and have plenty of time left to deliver the package.
Perhaps he was being too hasty.
\“Wait, Snake,\” Chameleon spoke quickly. \“I was being too abrupt. I beg your pardon.
I really would love to have a meal with you.
To prove it I will dine with you now and do my business after the meal!\”

\n\nSnake smiled to himself before he turned back toward Chameleon. \“Oh, Chameleon,\” Snake replied, sounding quite humble indeed,
\“Thank you! It is we who will be honoured by your presence, I assure you!\” And with that he led Chameleon off to his burrow.

\n\nSnake\’s wife had really outdone herself, as usual.
She\’d prepared a huge and sumptuous meal and truly was delighted to see that Chameleon had come to share it with them.
She encouraged him to have more and more,
and as it was so delicious, Chameleon helped himself until he was almost too full to move.
He was having such a good time,
and was especially enjoying Snake\’s outstanding utshwala (oo-chwah\’-lah = a traditional Zulu beer brewed from sorghum),
that he forgot all about his special mission.
Snake smiled slyly as he watched Chameleon\’s head nod and his eyelids droop.
Snake laughed aloud as Chameleon fell asleep with a satisfied little grunt.

\n\n\“What is so funny, my husband?\” asked Snake\’s wife, accustomed to the ways of nature to rest after the mid-day
meal in the hottest hours of the day.
She saw nothing strange or funny about Chameleon\’s behaviour.
It was actually a compliment to her as a hostess, that she had made her guest so comfortable and welcome.

\n\n\“Look here,\” Snake hissed, as he gently lifted the package from under Chameleon\’s arm.

\n\n\“What is that?\” she asked.

\n\n\“A gift for us from Creator,\” Snake laughed. And with that Snake tore open the parcel.
\“Look, my good wife,\” he exclaimed, lifting something from the box.
\“Creator has sent us new skins! New skins, so that whenever our old ones wear out we can change into new ones!\”
Snake laughed again, louder this time, waking his guest. Chameleon took one look at the parcel and immediately knew what had happened.

\n\n\“No, Snake!\” Chameleon pleaded, a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach.
\“Those are not for you! They are for people.
You know that! Give them back!\” Chameleon stretched out his hands toward the skins.
\“Please, Nyoka! Give them back!\”

\n\nBut Snake just laughed, holding the skins beyond Chameleon\’s reach.
\“No, my cousin.
These are my skins now!\” And with that Snake slithered away.

\n\nAs the sun went down Chameleon was sick with sadness for the way in which he\’d been
betrayed and for the way in which he had disobeyed.
He hid away from Creator in the braces of the trees, clinging to the limbs, moving slowly so as not to be detected.
He was too afraid to face Creator.

\n\n\“And so, you see, my children,\” finished Gogo, \“how it was that people were cheated out of new skins by Snake.
To this day snake will shed his old skin and don a new one whenever he is feeling his age.\”

\n\n\“But that’s not fair, Gogo!\” cried Methembe.\ “Creator should make Snake return the skins!\”

\n\n\“Ah, well, my boy,\” Gogo looked at him and placed a hand on his head, \“Life is not always fair.
But while Snake got the skins, Creator did not stop the people from standing on Snake from time-to-time.
In fact, when most people encounter Snake these days they give him what they think he deserves: a sound thrashing! And, of course,
Chameleon is still hiding away in the trees, moving so slowly that he usually goes undetected.
And as for people, well, Creator gave them another gift that was better than new skins!\”

\n\n\“What was that, Gogo?\” the children asked

\n\n“Oh, my children,\” Gogo replied with a smile, “That is a story for another time!
Now my weary old bones tell me that it is time for a good night\’s rest!\”

\n\nAnd with a great heave Gogo lifted herself from her stump by the fire and walked slowly toward her hut.

\n\n\“Lalani kahle, bantwana!\” (lah-lah\’-nee kah\’-hlay bah-ntwah\’-nah = \“Sleep well, children!\”)

Once upon a time, in a very hot country, a man lived with his wife in a little hut, which was surrounded by grass and flowers. They were perfectly happy together till, by-and-by, the woman fell ill and refused to take any food. The husband tried to persuade her to eat all sorts of delicious fruits that he had found in the forest, but she would have none of them, and grew so thin he feared she would die. ‘Is there nothing you would like?’ he said at last in despair.

\n\n‘Yes, I think I could eat some wild honey,’ answered she. The husband was overjoyed, for he thought this sounded easy enough to get, and he went off at once in search of it.

\n\n He came back with a wooden pan quite full, and gave it to his wife. ‘I can’t eat that,’ she said, turning away in disgust. ‘Look! there are some dead bees in it! I want honey that is quite pure.’ And the man threw the rejected honey on the grass, and started off to get some fresh. When he got back he offered it to his wife, who treated it as she had done the first bowlful. ‘That honey has got ants in it: throw it away,’ she said, and when he brought her some more, she declared it was full of earth. In his fourth journey he managed to find some that she would eat, and then she begged him to get her some water. This took him some time, but at length he came to a lake whose waters were sweetened with sugar. He filled a pannikin quite full, and carried it home to his wife, who drank it eagerly, and said that she now felt quite well. When she was up and had dressed herself, her husband lay down in her place, saying: ‘You have given me a great deal of trouble, and now it is my turn!’

\n\n‘What is the matter with you?’ asked the wife.

\n\n‘I am thirsty and want some water,’ answered he; and she took a large pot and carried it to the nearest spring, which was a good way off. ‘Here is the water,’ she said to her husband, lifting the heavy pot from her head; but he turned away in disgust.

\n\n‘You have drawn it from the pool that is full of frogs and willows; you must get me some more.’ So the woman set out again and walked still further to another lake.

\n\n‘This water tastes of rushes,’ he exclaimed, ‘go and get some fresh.’ But when she brought back a third supply he declared that it seemed made up of water-lilies, and that he must have water that was pure, and not spoilt by willows, or frogs, or rushes. So for the fourth time she put her jug on her head, and passing all the lakes she had hitherto tried, she came to another, where the water was golden like honey. She stooped down to drink, when a horrible head bobbed up on the surface.

\n\n‘How dare you steal my water?’ cried the head.

\n\n‘It is my husband who has sent me,’ she replied, trembling all over. ‘But do not kill me! You shall have my baby, if you will only let me go.’

\n\n‘How am I to know which is your baby?’ asked the Ogre.

\n\n‘Oh, that is easily managed. I will shave both sides of his head, and hang some white beads round his neck. And when you come to the hut you have only to call “Motikatika!” and he will run to meet you, and you can eat him.’

\n\n‘Very well,’ said the ogre, ‘you can go home.’ And after filling the pot she returned, and told her husband of the dreadful danger she had been in.

\n\nNow, though his mother did not know it, the baby was a magician and he had heard all that his mother had promised the ogre; and he laughed to himself as he planned how to outwit her.

\n\nThe next morning she shaved his head on both sides, and hung the white beads round his neck, and said to him: ‘I am going to the fields to work, but you must stay at home. Be sure you do not go outside, or some wild beast may eat you.’

\n\n‘Very well,’ answered he.

\n\nAs soon as his mother was out of sight, the baby took out some magic bones, and placed them in a row before him. ‘You are my father,’ he told one bone, ‘and you are my mother. You are the biggest,’ he said to the third, ‘so you shall be the ogre who wants to eat me; and you,’ to another, ‘are very little, therefore you shall be me. Now, then, tell me what I am to do.’

\n\n‘Collect all the babies in the village the same size as yourself,’ answered the bones; ‘shave the sides of their heads, and hang white beads round their necks, and tell them that when anybody calls “Motikatika,” they are to answer to it. And be quick for you have no time to lose.’

\n\nMotikatika went out directly, and brought back quite a crowd of babies, and shaved their heads and hung white beads round their little black necks, and just as he had finished, the ground began to shake, and the huge ogre came striding along, crying: ‘Motikatika! Motikatika!’

\n\n‘Here we are! here we are!’ answered the babies, all running to meet him.

\n\n‘It is Motikatika I want,’ said the ogre.

\n\n‘We are all Motikatika,’ they replied. And the ogre sat down in bewilderment, for he dared not eat the children of people who had done him no wrong, or a heavy punishment would befall him. The children waited for a little, wondering, and then they went away.

\n\nThe ogre remained where he was, till the evening, when the woman returned from the fields.

\n\n‘I have not seen Motikatika,’ said he.

\n\n‘But why did you not call him by his name, as I told you?’ she asked.

\n\n‘I did, but all the babies in the village seemed to be named Motikatika,’ answered the ogre; ‘you cannot think the number who came running to me.’

\n\nThe woman did not know what to make of it, so, to keep him in a good temper, she entered the hut and prepared a bowl of maize, which she brought him.

\n\n‘I do not want maize, I want the baby,’ grumbled he ‘and I will have him.’

\n\n‘Have patience,’ answered she; ‘I will call him, and you can eat him at once.’ And she went into the hut and cried, ‘Motikatika!’

\n\n‘I am coming, mother,’ replied he; but first he took out his bones, and, crouching down on the ground behind the hut, asked them how he should escape the ogre.

\n\n‘Change yourself into a mouse,’ said the bones; and so he did, and the ogre grew tired of waiting, and told the woman she must invent some other plan.

\n\n‘To-morrow I will send him into the field to pick some beans for me, and you will find him there, and can eat him.’

\n\n‘Very well,’ replied the ogre, ‘and this time I will take care to have him,’ and he went back to his lake.

\n\nNext morning Motikatika was sent out with a basket, and told to pick some beans for dinner. On the way to the field he took out his bones and asked them what he was to do to escape from the ogre. ‘Change yourself into a bird and snap off the beans,’ said the bones. And the ogre chased away the bird, not knowing that it was Motikatika.

\n\nThe ogre went back to the hut and told the woman that she had deceived him again, and that he would not be put off any longer.

\n\n‘Return here this evening,’ answered she, ‘and you will find him in bed under this white coverlet. Then you can carry him away, and eat him at once.’

\n\nBut the boy heard, and consulted his bones, which said: ‘Take the red coverlet from your father’s bed, and put yours on his,’ and so he did. And when the ogre came, he seized Motikatika’s father and carried him outside the hut and ate him. When his wife found out the mistake, she cried bitterly; but Motikatika said: ‘It is only just that he should be eaten, and not I; for it was he, and not I, who sent you to fetch the water.’

        <item>
On one of the great moors over in Jutland, where trees won’t grow because the soil is so sandy and the wind so strong, there once lived a man and his wife, who had a little house and some sheep, and two sons who helped them to herd them. The elder of the two was called Rasmus, and the younger Niels. Rasmus was quite content to look after sheep, as his father had done before him, but Niels had a fancy to be a hunter, and was not happy till he got hold of a gun and learned to shoot. It was only an old muzzle-loading flint-lock after all, but Niels thought it a great prize, and went about shooting at everything he could see. So much did he practice that in the long run he became a wonderful shot, and was heard of even where he had never been seen. Some people said there was very little in him beyond this, but that was an idea they found reason to change in the course of time.

\n\nThe parents of Rasmus and Niels were good Catholics, and when they were getting old the mother took it into her head that she would like to go to Rome and see the Pope. The others didn’t see much use in this, but she had her way in the end: they sold all the sheep, shut up the house, and set out for Rome on foot. Niels took his gun with him.

\n\n‘What do you want with that?’ said Rasmus; ‘we have plenty to carry without it.’ But Niels could not be happy without his gun, and took it all the same.

\n\nIt was in the hottest part of summer that they began their journey, so hot that they could not travel at all in the middle of the day, and they were afraid to do it by night lest they might lose their way or fall into the hands of robbers. One day, a little before sunset, they came to an inn which lay at the edge of a forest.

\n\n‘We had better stay here for the night,’ said Rasmus.

\n\n‘What an idea!’ said Niels, who was growing impatient at the slow progress they were making. ‘We can’t travel by day for the heat, and we remain where we are all night. It will be long enough before we get to Rome if we go on at this rate.’

\n\nRasmus was unwilling to go on, but the two old people sided with Niels, who said, ‘The nights aren’t dark, and the moon will soon be up. We can ask at the inn here, and find out which way we ought to take.’

\n\nSo they held on for some time, but at last they came to a small opening in the forest, and here they found that the road split in two. There was no sign-post to direct them, and the people in the inn had not told them which of the two roads to take.

\n\n‘What’s to be done now?’ said Rasmus. ‘I think we had better have stayed at the inn.’

\n\n‘There’s no harm done,’ said Niels. ‘The night is warm, and we can wait here till morning. One of us will keep watch till midnight, and then waken the other.’

\n\nRasmus chose to take the first watch, and the others lay down to sleep. It was very quiet in the forest, and Rasmus could hear the deer and foxes and other animals moving about among the rustling leaves. After the moon rose he could see them occasionally, and when a big stag came quite close to him he got hold of Niels’ gun and shot it.

\n\nNiels was wakened by the report. ‘What’s that?’ he said.

\n\n‘I’ve just shot a stag,’ said Rasmus, highly pleased with himself.

\n\n‘That’s nothing,’ said Niels. ‘I’ve often shot a sparrow, which is a much more difficult thing to do.’

\n\nIt was now close on midnight, so Niels began his watch, and Rasmus went to sleep. It began to get colder, and Niels began to walk about a little to keep himself warm. He soon found that they were not far from the edge of the forest, and when he climbed up one of the trees there he could see out over the open country beyond. At a little distance he saw a fire, and beside it there sat three giants, busy with broth and beef. They were so huge that the spoons they used were as large as spades, and their forks as big as hay-forks: with these they lifted whole bucketfuls of broth and great joints of meat out of an enormous pot which was set on the ground between them. Niels was startled and rather scared at first, but he comforted himself with the thought that the giants were a good way off, and that if they came nearer he could easily hide among the bushes. After watching them for a little, however, he began to get over his alarm, and finally slid down the tree again, resolved to get his gun and play some tricks with them.

\n\nWhen he had climbed back to his former position, he took good aim, and waited till one of the giants was just in the act of putting a large piece of meat into his mouth. Bang! went Niels’ gun, and the bullet struck the handle of the fork so hard that the point went into the giant’s chin, instead of his mouth.

\n\n‘None of your tricks,’ growled the giant to the one who sat next him. ‘What do you mean by hitting my fork like that, and making me prick myself?’

\n\n‘I never touched your fork,’ said the other. ‘Don’t try to get up a quarrel with me.’

\n\n‘Look at it, then,’ said the first. ‘Do you suppose I stuck it into my own chin for fun?’

\n\nThe two got so angry over the matter that each offered to fight the other there and then, but the third giant acted as peace-maker, and they again fell to their eating.

\n\nWhile the quarrel was going on, Niels had loaded the gun again, and just as the second giant was about to put a nice tit-bit into his mouth, bang! went the gun again, and the fork flew into a dozen pieces.

\n\nThis giant was even more furious than the first had been, and words were just coming to blows, when the third giant again interposed.

\n\n‘Don’t be fools,’ he said to them; ‘what’s the good of beginning to fight among ourselves, when it is so necessary for the three of us to work together and get the upper hand over the king of this country. It will be a hard enough task as it is, but it will be altogether hopeless if we don’t stick together. Sit down again, and let us finish our meal; I shall sit between you, and then neither of you can blame the other.’

\n\nNiels was too far away to hear their talk, but from their gestures he could guess what was happening, and thought it good fun.

\n\n‘Thrice is lucky,’ said he to himself; ‘I’ll have another shot yet.’

\n\nThis time it was the third giant’s fork that caught the bullet, and snapped in two.

\n\n‘Well,’ said he, ‘if I were as foolish as you two, I would also fly into a rage, but I begin to see what time of day it is, and I’m going off this minute to see who it is that’s playing these tricks with us.’

\n\nSo well had the giant made his observations, that though Niels climbed down the tree as fast as he could, so as to hide among the bushes, he had just got to the ground when the enemy was upon him.

\n\n‘Stay where you are,’ said the giant, ‘or I’ll put my foot on you, and there won’t be much of you left after that.’

\n\nNiels gave in, and the giant carried him back to his comrades.

\n\n‘You don’t deserve any mercy at our hands,’ said his captor ‘but as you are such a good shot you may be of great use to us, so we shall spare your life, if you will do us a service. Not far from here there stands a castle, in which the king’s daughter lives; we are at war with the king, and want to get the upper hand of him by carrying off the princess, but the castle is so well guarded that there is no getting into it. By our skill in magic we have cast sleep on every living thing in the castle, except a little black dog, and, as long as he is awake, we are no better off than before; for, as soon as we begin to climb over the wall, the little dog will hear us, and its barking will waken all the others again. Having got you, we can place you where you will be able to shoot the dog before it begins to bark, and then no one can hinder us from getting the princess into our hands. If you do that, we shall not only let you off, but reward you handsomely.’

\n\nNiels had to consent, and the giants set out for the castle at once. It was surrounded by a very high rampart, so high that even the giants could not touch the top of it. ‘How am I to get over that?’ said Niels.

\n\n‘Quite easily,’ said the third giant; ‘I’ll throw you up on it.’

\n\n‘No, thanks,’ said Niels. ‘I might fall down on the other side, or break my leg or neck, and then the little dog wouldn’t get shot after all.’

\n\n‘No fear of that,’ said the giant; ‘the rampart is quite wide on the top, and covered with long grass, so that you will come down as softly as though you fell on a feather-bed.’

\n\nNiels had to believe him, and allowed the giant to throw him up. He came down on his feet quite unhurt, but the little black dog heard the dump, and rushed out of its kennel at once. It was just opening its mouth to bark, when Niels fired, and it fell dead on the spot.

\n\n‘Go down on the inside now,’ said the giant, ‘and see if you can open the gate to us.’

\n\nNiels made his way down into the courtyard, but on his way to the outer gate he found himself at the entrance to the large hall of the castle. The door was open, and the hall was brilliantly lighted, though there was no one to be seen. Niels went in here and looked round him: on the wall there hung a huge sword without a sheath, and beneath it was a large drinking-horn, mounted with silver. Niels went closer to look at these, and saw that the horn had letters engraved on the silver rim: when he took it down and turned it round, he found that the inscription was:—

\n\n\t\t\t\tWhoever drinks the wine I hold
\n\t\t\t\tCan wield the sword that hangs above;
\n\t\t\t\tThen let him use it for the right,
\n\t\t\t\t And win a royal maiden’s love.
\n\nNiels took out the silver stopper of the horn, and drank some of the wine, but when he tried to take down the sword he found himself unable to move it. So he hung up the horn again, and went further in to the castle. ‘The giants can wait a little,’ he said.

\n\nBefore long he came to an apartment in which a beautiful princess lay asleep in a bed, and on a table by her side there lay a gold-hemmed handkerchief. Niels tore this in two, and put one half in his pocket, leaving the other half on the table. On the floor he saw a pair of gold-embroidered slippers, and one of these he also put in his pocket. After that he went back to the hall, and took down the horn again. ‘Perhaps I have to drink all that is in it before I can move the sword,’ he thought; so he put it to his lips again and drank till it was quite empty. When he had done this, he could wield the sword with the greatest of ease, and felt himself strong enough to do anything, even to fight the giants he had left outside, who were no doubt wondering why he had not opened the gate to them before this time. To kill the giants, he thought, would be using the sword for the right; but as to winning the love of the princess, that was a thing which the son of a poor sheep-farmer need not hope for.

\n\nWhen Niels came to the gate of the castle, he found that there was a large door and a small one, so he opened the latter.

\n\n‘Can’t you open the big door?’ said the giants; ‘we shall hardly be able to get in at this one.’

\n\n‘The bars are too heavy for me to draw,’ said Niels; ‘if you stoop a little you can quite well come in here.’ The first giant accordingly bent down and entered in a stooping posture, but before he had time to straighten his back again Niels made a sweep with the sword, and oft went the giant’s head. To push the body aside as it fell was quite easy for Niels, so strong had the wine made him, and the second giant as he entered met the same reception. The third was slower in coming, so Niels called out to him: ‘Be quick,’ he said, ‘you are surely the oldest of the three, since you are so slow in your movements, but I can’t wait here long; I must get back to my own people as soon as possible.’ So the third also came in, and was served in the same way. It appears from the story that giants were not given fair play!

\n\nBy this time day was beginning to break, and Niels thought that his folks might already be searching for him, so, instead of waiting to see what took place at the castle, he ran off to the forest as fast as he could, taking the sword with him. He found the others still asleep, so he woke them up, and they again set out on their journey. Of the night’s adventures he said not a word, and when they asked where he got the sword, he only pointed in the direction of the castle, and said, ‘Over that way.’ They thought he had found it, and asked no more questions.

\n\nWhen Niels left the castle, he shut the door behind him, and it closed with such a bang that the porter woke up. He could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw the three headless giants lying in a heap in the courtyard, and could not imagine what had taken place. The whole castle was soon aroused, and then everybody wondered at the affair: it was soon seen that the bodies were those of the king’s great enemies, but how they came to be there and in that condition was a perfect mystery. Then it was noticed that the drinking-horn was empty and the sword gone, while the princess reported that half of her handkerchief and one of her slippers had been taken away. How the giants had been killed seemed a little clearer now, but who had done it was as great a puzzle as before. The old knight who had charge of the castle said that in his opinion it must have been some young knight, who had immediately set off to the king to claim the hand of the princess. This sounded likely, but the messenger who was sent to the Court returned with the news that no one there knew anything about the matter.

\n\n‘We must find him, however,’ said the princess; ‘for if he is willing to marry me I cannot in honour refuse him, after what my father put on the horn.’ She took council with her father’s wisest men as to what ought to be done, and among other things they advised her to build a house beside the highway, and put over the door this inscription:—‘Whoever will tell the story of his life, may stay here three nights for nothing.’ This was done, and many strange tales were told to the princess, but none of the travellers said a word about the three giants.

\n\nIn the meantime Niels and the others tramped on towards Rome. Autumn passed, and winter was just beginning when they came to the foot of a great range of mountains, towering up to the sky. ‘Must we go over these?’ said they. ‘We shall be frozen to death or buried in the snow.’

\n\n‘Here comes a man,’ said Niels; ‘let us ask him the way to Rome.’ They did so, and were told that there was no other way.

\n\n‘And is it far yet?’ said the old people, who were beginning to be worn out by the long journey. The man held up his foot so that they could see the sole of his shoe; it was worn as thin as paper, and there was a hole in the middle of it.

\n\n‘These shoes were quite new when I left Rome,’ he said, ‘and look at them now; that will tell you whether you are far from it or not.’

\n\nThis discouraged the old people so much that they gave up all thought of finishing the journey, and only wished to get back to Denmark as quickly as they could. What with the winter and bad roads they took longer to return than they had taken to go, but in the end they found themselves in sight of the forest where they had slept before.

\n\n‘What’s this?’ said Rasmus. ‘Here’s a big house built since we passed this way before.’

\n\n‘So it is,’ said Peter; ‘let’s stay all night in it.’

\n\n‘No, we can’t afford that,’ said the old people; ‘it will be too dear for the like of us.’

\n\nHowever, when they saw what was written above the door, they were all well pleased to get a night’s lodging for nothing. They were well received, and had so much attention given to them, that the old people were quite put out by it. After they had got time to rest themselves, the princess’s steward came to hear their story.

\n\n‘You saw what was written above the door,’ he said to the father. ‘Tell me who you are and what your history has been.’

\n\n‘Dear me, I have nothing of any importance to tell you,’ said the old man, ‘and I am sure we should never have made so bold as to trouble you at all if it hadn’t been for the youngest of our two sons here.’

\n\n‘Never mind that,’ said the steward; ‘you are very welcome if you will only tell me the story of your life.’

\n\n‘Well, well, I will,’ said he, ‘but there is nothing to tell about it. I and my wife have lived all our days on a moor in North Jutland, until this last year, when she took a fancy to go to Rome. We set out with our two sons but turned back long before we got there, and are now on our way home again. That’s all my own story, and our two sons have lived with us all their days, so there is nothing more to be told about them either.’

\n\n‘Yes there is,’ said Rasmus; ‘when we were on our way south, we slept in the wood near here one night, and I shot a stag.’

\n\nThe steward was so much accustomed to hearing stories of no importance that he thought there was no use going further with this, but reported to the princess that the newcomers had nothing to tell.

\n\n‘Did you question them all?’ she said.

\n\n‘Well, no; not directly,’ said he; ‘but the father said that none of them could tell me any more than he had done.’

\n\n‘You are getting careless,’ said the princess; ‘I shall go and talk to them myself.’

\n\nNiels knew the princess again as soon as she entered the room, and was greatly alarmed, for he immediately supposed that all this was a device to discover the person who had run away with the sword, the slipper and the half of the handkerchief, and that it would fare badly with him if he were discovered. So he told his story much the same as the others did (Niels was not very particular), and thought he had escaped all further trouble, when Rasmus put in his word. ‘You’ve forgotten something, Niels,’ he said; ‘you remember you found a sword near here that night I shot the stag.’

\n\n‘Where is the sword?’ said the princess.

\n\n‘I know,’ said the steward, ‘I saw where he laid it down when they came in;’ and off he went to fetch it, while Niels wondered whether he could make his escape in the meantime. Before he had made up his mind, however, the steward was back with the sword, which the princess recognised at once.

\n\n‘Where did you get this?’ she said to Niels.

\n\nNiels was silent, and wondered what the usual penalty was for a poor sheep-farmer’s son who was so unfortunate as to deliver a princess and carry off things from her bed-room.

\n\n‘See what else he has about him,’ said the princess to the steward, and Niels had to submit to be searched: out of one pocket came a gold-embroidered slipper, and out of another the half of a gold-hemmed handkerchief.

\n\n‘That is enough,’ said the princess; ‘now we needn’t ask any more questions. Send for my father the king at once.’

\n\n‘Please let me go,’ said Niels; ‘I did you as much good as harm, at any rate.’

\n\n‘Why, who said anything about doing harm?’ said the princess. ‘You must stay here till my father comes.’

\n\nThe way in which the princess smiled when she said this gave Niels some hope that things might not be bad for him after all, and he was yet more encouraged when he thought of the words engraver on the horn, though the last line still seemed too good to be true. However, the arrival of the king soon settled the matter: the princess was willing and so was Niels, and in a few days the wedding bells were ringing. Niels was made an earl by that time, and looked as handsome as any of them when dressed in all his robes. Before long the old king died, and Niels reigned after him; but whether his father and mother stayed with him, or went back to the moor in Jutland, or were sent to Rome in a carriage and four, is something that all the historians of his reign have forgotten to mention.

Once upon a time there lived a man whose name was Abu Nowas, and he was a great favourite with the Sultan of the country, who had a palace in the same town where Abu Nowas dwelt.

\n\nOne day Abu Nowas came weeping into the hall of the palace where the Sultan was sitting, and said to him: ‘Oh, mighty Sultan, my wife is dead.’

\n\n‘That is bad news,’ replied the Sultan; ‘I must get you another wife.’ And he bade his Grand Vizir send for the Sultana.

\n\n‘This poor Abu Nowas has lost his wife,’ said he, when she entered the hall.

\n\n‘Oh, then we must get him another,’ answered the Sultana; ‘I have a girl that will suit him exactly,’ and clapped her hands loudly. At this signal a maiden appeared and stood before her.

\n\n‘I have got a husband for you,’ said the Sultana.

\n\n‘Who is he?’ asked the girl.

\n\n‘Abu Nowas, the jester,’ replied the Sultana.

\n\n‘I will take him,’ answered the maiden; and as Abu Nowas made no objection, it was all arranged. The Sultana had the most beautiful clothes made for the bride, and the Sultan gave the bridegroom his wedding suit, and a thousand gold pieces into the bargain, and soft carpets for the house.

\n\nSo Abu Nowas took his wife home, and for some time they were very happy, and spent the money freely which the Sultan had given them, never thinking what they should do for more when that was gone. But come to an end it did, and they had to sell their fine things one by one, till at length nothing was left but a cloak apiece, and one blanket to cover them. ‘We have run through our fortune,’ said Abu Nowas, ‘what are we to do now? I am afraid to go back to the Sultan, for he will command his servants to turn me from the door. But you shall return to your mistress, and throw yourself at her feet and weep, and perhaps she will help us.’

\n\n‘Oh, you had much better go,’ said the wife. ‘I shall not know what to say.’

\n\n‘Well, then, stay at home, if you like,’ answered Abu Nowas, ‘and I will ask to be admitted to the Sultan’s presence, and will tell him, with sobs, that my wife is dead, and that I have no money for her burial. When he hears that perhaps he will give us something.’

\n\n‘Yes, that is a good plan,’ said the wife; and Abu Nowas set out.

\n\nThe Sultan was sitting in the hall of justice when Abu Nowas entered, his eyes streaming with tears, for he had rubbed some pepper into them. They smarted dreadfully, and he could hardly see to walk straight, and everyone wondered what was the matter with him.

\n\n‘Abu Nowas! What has happened?’ cried the Sultan.

\n\n‘Oh, noble Sultan, my wife is dead,’ wept he.

\n\n‘We must all die,’ answered the Sultan; but this was not the reply for which Abu Nowas had hoped.

\n\n‘True, O Sultan, but I have neither shroud to wrap her in, nor money to bury her with,’ went on Abu Nowas, in no wise abashed by the way the Sultan had received his news.

\n\n‘Well, give him a hundred pieces of gold,’ said the Sultan, turning to the Grand Vizir. And when the money was counted out Abu Nowas bowed low, and left the hall, his tears still flowing, but with joy in his heart.

\n\n‘Have you got anything?’ cried his wife, who was waiting for him anxiously.

\n\n‘Yes, a hundred gold pieces,’ said he, throwing down the bag, ‘but that will not last us any time. Now you must go to the Sultana, clothed in sackcloth and robes of mourning, and tell her that your husband, Abu Nowas, is dead, and you have no money for his burial. When she hears that, she will be sure to ask you what has become of the money and the fine clothes she gave us on our marriage, and you will answer, “before he died he sold everything.”’

\n\nThe wife did as she was told, and wrapping herself in sackcloth went up to the Sultana’s own palace, and as she was known to have been one of Subida’s favourite attendants, she was taken without difficulty into the private apartments.

\n\n‘What is the matter?’ inquired the Sultana, at the sight of the dismal figure.

\n\n‘My husband lies dead at home, and he has spent all our money, and sold everything, and I have nothing left to bury him with,’ sobbed the wife.

\n\nThen Subida took up a purse containing two hundred gold pieces, and said: ‘Your husband served us long and faithfully. You must see that he has a fine funeral.’

\n\nThe wife took the money, and, kissing the feet of the Sultana, she joyfully hastened home. They spent some happy hours planning how they should spend it, and thinking how clever they had been. ‘When the Sultan goes this evening to Subida’s palace,’ said Abu Nowas, ‘she will be sure to tell him that Abu Nowas is dead. “Not Abu Nowas, it is his wife,” he will reply, and they will quarrel over it, and all the time we shall be sitting here enjoying ourselves. Oh, if they only knew, how angry they would be!’

\n\nAs Abu Nowas had foreseen, the Sultan went, in the evening after his business was over, to pay his usual visit to the Sultana.

\n\n‘Poor Abu Nowas is dead!’ said Subida when he entered the room.

\n\n‘It is not Abu Nowas, but his wife who is dead,’ answered the Sultan.

\n\n‘No; really you are quite wrong. She came to tell me herself only a couple of hours ago,’ replied Subida, ‘and as he had spent all their money, I gave her something to bury him with.’

\n\n‘You must be dreaming,’ exclaimed the Sultan. ‘Soon after midday Abu Nowas came into the hall, his eyes streaming with tears, and when I asked him the reason he answered that his wife was dead, and they had sold everything they had, and he had nothing left, not so much as would buy her a shroud, far less for her burial.’

\n\nFor a long time they talked, and neither would listen to the other, till the Sultan sent for the door-keeper and bade him go instantly to the house of Abu Nowas and see if it was the man or his wife who was dead. But Abu Nowas happened to be sitting with his wife behind the latticed window, which looked on the street, and he saw the man coming, and sprang up at once. ‘There is the Sultan’s door-keeper! They have sent him here to find out the truth. Quick! throw yourself on the bed and pretend that you are dead.’ And in a moment the wife was stretched out stiffly, with a linen sheet spread across her, like a corpse.

\n\nShe was only just in time, for the sheet was hardly drawn across her when the door opened and the porter came in. ‘Has anything happened?’ asked he.

\n\n‘My poor wife is dead,’ replied Abu Nowas. ‘Look! she is laid out here.’ And the porter approached the bed, which was in a corner of the room, and saw the stiff form lying underneath.

\n\n‘We must all die,’ said he, and went back to the Sultan.

\n\n‘Well, have you found out which of them is dead?’ asked the Sultan.

\n\n‘Yes, noble Sultan; it is the wife,’ replied the porter.

\n\n‘He only says that to please you,’ cried Subida in a rage; and calling to her chamberlain, she ordered him to go at once to the dwelling of Abu Nowas and see which of the two was dead. ‘And be sure you tell the truth about it,’ added she, ‘or it will be the worse for you.’

\n\nAs her chamberlain drew near the house, Abu Nowas caught sight of him. ‘There is the Sultana’s chamberlain,’ he exclaimed in a fright. ‘Now it is my turn to die. Be quick and spread the sheet over me.’ And he laid himself on the bed, and held his breath when the chamberlain came in. ‘What are you weeping for?’ asked the man, finding the wife in tears.

\n\n‘My husband is dead,’ answered she, pointing to the bed; and the chamberlain drew back the sheet and beheld Abu Nowas lying stiff and motionless. Then he gently replaced the sheet and returned to the palace.

\n\n‘Well, have you found out this time?’ asked the Sultan.

\n\n‘My lord, it is the husband who is dead.’

\n\n‘But I tell you he was with me only a few hours ago,’ cried the Sultan angrily. ‘I must get to the bottom of this before I sleep! Let my golden coach be brought round at once.’

\n\nThe coach was before the door in another five minutes, and the Sultan and Sultana both got in. Abu Nowas had ceased being a dead man, and was looking into the street when he saw the coach coming. ‘Quick! quick!’ he called to his wife. ‘The Sultan will be here directly, and we must both be dead to receive him.’ So they laid themselves down, and spread the sheet over them, and held their breath. At that instant the Sultan entered, followed by the Sultana and the chamberlain, and he went up to the bed and found the corpses stiff and motionless. ‘I would give a thousand gold pieces to anyone who would tell me the truth about this,’ cried he, and at the words Abu Nowas sat up. ‘Give them to me, then,’ said he, holding out his hand. ‘You cannot give them to anyone who needs them more.’

\n\n‘Oh, Abu Nowas, you impudent dog!’ exclaimed the Sultan, bursting into a laugh, in which the Sultana joined. ‘I might have known it was one of your tricks!’ But he sent Abu Nowas the gold he had promised, and let us hope that it did not fly so fast as the last had done.
