Last weekend, in the penthouse of an upscale, downtown hotel, I attended my first sex party.
I went with a friend of mine—I\’ll call her Anne—who\’s been
bugging me to come along to this particular event for months,
on the grounds that I can\’t call myself a true sex writer until I’ve been to an orgy,
Fair enough, I thought.\n

\n\“It\’s the best sex party in New York, with the most fun, attractive crowd,\” Anne assured me,
adding that the attendees are a mix of swingers, \“burners\” (Burning Man–types),
and fetish people. I was skeptical.\n
How amazing could the participants of a paid orgy really be, even if it was invite-only?
I also had serious reservations about whether I would actually be able to hook up amidst
a crowd of \“roughly 100 people.\” \nBut I trusted Anne, because she knows a lot about this stuff.
See, Anne and her husband are in an open marriage: They\’re happy, successful, attractive,
deeply in love, and they also get to sleep with whomever they want. How unfair.\n

\nI\’ve written previously about my own attempt to make an open relationship work.
The year my girlfriend and I were open, our relationship was strained by arguments and insecurity,
and our subsequent attempt at monogamy didn\’t work out either. Sadly,
two weeks ago, she and I broke up. And I have since
finally admitted it to myself: monogamy just isn\’t for me.
Or at least not right now. The problem is,
I\’m still in the dark about how to make a nonmonogamous relationship function.
It just feels like there\’s so much working against you—jealousy, possession, unwilling partners,
and a weighty social stigma. My hope was that spending time with Anne and her husband,
as well as a room full of orgiastic swingers,
would give me some insight into how I could have my relationship cake and eat it too.\n

\nAccording to Anne, a 32-year-old nurse, being nonmonogamous wasn\'t a desire but a necessity.
\"In my late teens and early twenties I had two long-term relationships,
one with a man and one with a woman,\” she explained. \“In both cases they were older than me,
and both tried to convince me that when you really love someone,
you don\’t want to be with other people. I thought that because they were older, they knew better.
So I tried it, but both times I failed miserably—it was stressful,
I cheated so much, and I hurt my partners.\”
During that time Anne realized that, in fact,
her desire to get laid by other people didn\’t mean she loved her partners any less.
\“Restricting myself doesn\’t make me happy,\” she went on, \“so after the second relationship ended,
I said, \‘This is stupid, I\’m never promising monogamy to anyone ever again.\’\”\n

\nThat decision has worked out well for her, because she ended up meeting her perfect match.
\“My husband and I met through a couple that we were both sleeping with separately,\” she said.
\“And there was never any expectation of monogamy.\”
She describes their marriage as being \“very open,\” but there are still ground rules.
\"Initially we had a zip-code rule,\” she explained.
\“When we were in the same city, we could hook up with other people together—threesomes,
sex parties, etcetera—and when he traveled for work, we could play separately.
\" However, as their relationship became stronger, their boundaries loosened,
and now they can hook up whenever, as long as their extracurricular sex remains casual.
\“You have to challenge yourself,\” Anne said. \“If something doesn\’t feel comfortable,
you ask yourself why that is, and try to understand if and why your jealousy is irrational.\”\n

\nBut back to the sex party. Clearly, my biggest dilemma was what to wear:
A cocktail dress? A gown? Lingerie under a trench coat? After much deliberation,
I finally decided on a candy-pink-and-white eighties Escada power suit and white stilettos,
figuring that, if ever there were a time to look like a horny version of the First Lady, this was it.\n

\nWalking into the hotel, I was slightly intimidated by how many beautiful,
well-dressed people there were. (Anne was right.) For the first two hours,
people mostly danced, drank the free booze, and ate canapes. Many of the
guests were clearly already friends or \“playmates,\” and the atmosphere was
surprisingly classy, even reserved. It wasn\’t until midnight that the suits
and cocktail dresses began to come off. Suddenly the many beds, couches,
and bathtubs were filled with people going at it.\n

\n Popular depictions of swingers are usually sensational or retro,
but the crowd at the party seemed like normal, nice people who were no different from me,
which was encouraging. I instantly noticed how respectful everyone was. Before engaging
with another person, it was customary to ask,
\“Can I touch you?\” The couples were very frank about the advantages of \“the lifestyle,\”
as it\’s called. One said that listening to each other\’s hook-up stories was their ultimate turn on.
Another couple, when asked about the virtues of being open,
said that it prevents them from getting lazy or taking each other for granted—the
slight competition keeps them engaged and motivates them to win each other’s affection every day.\n

\nSex parties like this one,and discussions about alternatives to monogamy,
have been getting increasing media coverage in recent years.\n
Dan Savage, of course, is an active proponent of what he calls \“monogamish\”—opening the
door of your relationship just a crack, to keep it from blowing off its hinges, as he puts it.
The Ethical Slut, which is probably the quintessential book on nonmonogamy,
has been selling consistently since its publication in 1997. And then there’s Sex at Dawn,
Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá\’s 2010 bestseller, which argues that monogamy goes a
gainst human nature. The book\’s enormous popularity
spawned countless articles and debates about whether
monogamy is in fact a social construct, and one that goes against our biology.\n

\nBut what do the alternatives look like in practice?
To get a more detailed idea of how people manage
nonmonogamy successfully, I’d spoken with Dr. Zhana Vrangalova,
a researcher and adjunct professor of human sexuality at NYU.
Vrangalova had explained that nonmonogamous relationships
generally fall into one of three main categories:
swinging, polyamory, and open relationships.
Swingers are the most couple-centric of the three—these are
lovers in a committed relationship who have strictly casual s
ex with other people, which they typically engage in together,
at a swingers\’ party or some other \“lifestyle\” event.
Open relationships are similar in that a committed couple can have casual hook-ups,
but their extracurricular sex tends to happen independently.
These couples will usually create specific boundaries based on
their personal comfort levels—for instance, a \“no sleepovers\” rule,
or an \“area-code\” rule. Finally, polyamorous refers to
people who have multiple simultaneous relationships that are not just sexual,
but emotional and romantic as well. For instance, one could have a
primary partner and a secondary partner,
or three or four people could all be romantically linked together,
known as a triad or a quad, respectively.\n


\nIn other words, it\’s pretty complicated, and making it work requires serious effort.
And from what I gathered at the sex party, this is very much the case.
I was repeatedly struck, not just by their respectful demeanor,
but also by how thoroughly—almost tediously—the partners communicated.
Because trust is key, people are very vocal and direct about their desires and comfort levels.
\“What\’s your rule?\” was probably the most common question of the evening,
as people tried to gauge each other\’s relationship boundaries.
I had a girl in her early thirties walk up to me and say, \"Hey, would you like to play?\"
When I nodded yes, she said, \"OK, but it has to be on this bed,
because that\'s my husband getting a blow job over there,
and our rule is that we can play independently as long as we are in the same room.\"\n

\nThere was also a certain lingo that everyone there seemed familiar with. At one point,
a group was discussing how they deal with \“N.R.E.,\” which someone eventually explained to
me stands for \“new relationship energy.\” \“N.R.E. is inevitable,\” one woman said.
\“When your partner is having N.R.E. with a new hook-up,
it can make you feel uncomfortable or jealous,
but you have to remind yourself that it\’s normal,
and that it will eventually fade.\” The unashamed,
straightforward nature of it all was strangely charming.\n

\nI kept thinking that, underneath all the openness,
there had to be a considerable base level of security in these relationships.
It can\’t be easy to say, \“Have fun at the orgy, honey,\” if you suspect your partner might
leave you for one of his or her hook-ups. Anne confirmed this.
\“Security in your relationship is critical,\” she urged.
“But confidence in yourself and your self-worth is equally important.
I know that I\’m a good, valuable person, and that even if my husband left me for someone else,
I would be fine. That\’s a big deal.\" And here is where I might run into challenges.
Even if you\’re a confident person, and confident in your sexuality,
feeling secure in a relationship is a more slippery slope. At least for me.
I\’ll admit that I can be a jealous person and a total hypocrite—I want to be
free to do whatever I want while my partner stays locked in a cage. (Duh.) Many
of my past relationships have been tainted by insecurity, jealousy, cheating,
and lying, often fueled by bad communication and secrecy.\n

\nBy comparison, the couples at the party seemed open and honest in a way
that many \“normal\” couples aren\’t. Let\’s not kid ourselves: adultery is rife.
In a way, the socially accepted norm of monogamy requires lying.
It\’s almost like monogamous couples actually prefer to be lied to rather
than deal with the uncomfortable reality of extramarital attraction.
With nonmonogamy, you\’re admittedly entering into risky territory.
But with ground rules and communication, the result could be a more honest,
fulfilling relationship. And since keeping jealousy in check and feeling
secure can be the hardest parts of maintaining a relationship for me,
I began to wonder if nonmonogamy could teach me something on a deeper level that
monogamy couldn\’t—if perhaps these orgy people were really onto something.\n

\nAt the party, I ended up getting to second base—further than I expected to go—with a
Williamsburg-ish-looking couple in their twenties. Still, my nerves eventually
led me to drink a little too much, and I ended up falling asleep at the height of the orgy.
(Embarrassing.) I was eventually woken up by a very nice woman. \“Sorry, honey,
you can\’t sleep on this bed,\” she said. \“People need to have sex here.\”\n\n

It was raining outside and the thunder was banging loud against the
windows as I lay in my bed alone. Waiting for the time to pass I laid there thinking of you,
as I always do when I have spare time. I start to think of what it will be like if we ever get to meet.
As for right now you are just a figment on my imagination. \nThe long talks on the phone,
the hours spent online together, but we have yet to cross those barriors.
s I lay in bed thinking of when I will get to talk to you next, my mind wanders into the unknown,
wondering what you feel like, taste like, smell like,
it gets me very excited because I know what you sound like, and pretty much what you look like.
My mind wanders to those long phone calls where we pleasure eachother by sound and mental emotion.
I sigh with longing as I run my hands down over my chest and stomache and back up again
lifting my t-shirt as I go. \nI trace my fingers leaving a tingling sensation all over my chest.
I close my eyes and daydream it is you doing this to me.
I get the chills of the power of thought you have over me.\n

\nI let my fingers run over my left nipple which gets erect instantly... as
I think it\'s you. I follow a path across to my right tit and do the same,
Now each of my nipples are hard little pebbles. I pinch and squeeze my
right nipple bringing a wetness and heat inside of me, Leaving me aching for more.
With my eyes closed I bite my bottom lip, moaning and screaming deep inside how
I wish it was you playing with my nipples making me feel this good. I lean over
and get the candle I had lit earlier it\'s scent of lavender permieates the air.
I bring the candle just over my chest and slowly let it drip onto my left nipple,
feeling the shock of the heat I scream out. \nGod it feels so good, wanting more I do
the same to my right nipple. I get even more excited then I was before,
as I know what me doing this does to you. I can hear your breathing in my head,
the sounds of you getting excited and hard as a rock.\n

\nIt makes me want tofuck so hard and fast... I place the candle back in the holder
on the bedside table and
wiggle around in my bed kicking off the heavy comforter, I sit up and slide off my
shirt the only article of clothing I have on. I lean back down and run my hands all
over my smooth tan body leaving chill bumps all over me. I run my hand along my stomache ,
down lower to my shaven mound. I massage myself feeling the stirring of want deep with in me.
I am starting to get soaked, I can feel my juices flowing. I lean and look down.
I see my little pink pussy starting to glisten in the candle light.
I slowly start to massage my pussy faster with my palm making me shiver and shake.
it feels so good, I moam outloud.
\nI think I need more so I slowly use my index finger and trace over the opening of my pussy,
teasing myself to the point of almost climaxing. I slowly guide my
fingers over my pink tight lips teasing and pinching them,
i can feel the wetness flowing over them from deep with in me.
I run my index finger up and over my clit making me moan out loud.
I start to massage it bringing up the ache inside me now,
I pinch it and pull it making it hard like a pebble.\n


\nI continue to play with my now hard clit concentrating on making circles over it with my finger,
pushing it in every few seconds,
Welling up inside me is an orgasm that is about to escape,
I spread my legs wide open and raise my ass up high and rub my clit faster then before.
Feeling the orgasm start to explode I slam my middle finger
inside my pussy lips and start to finger fuck myself hard,
not once stopping to pay attention to my clit.\n
My naked sweaty body starts to shake and rock into climatic convulsions.
I am moaning out loud, your name upon my lips, I bite down so as not to scream out.
As my first orgasm subsides, I continue to slowly finger fuck myself this time letting my clit alone,
I slide another finger in, my index finger.\n
I lean up almost sitting so I can watch my slender
fingers slide in and out through my pink moist velvety swollen lips.
I can see as the tips of my nails which are painted blue slide in and get
lost deep within my pussy walls.\n
I throw my head back letting my hair flow over my bare shoulders,
starting to move on my fingers I ride into them as if I were riding your cock.
I slide yet another finger inside of my pussy now
using 3 which makes my pussy squeeze tight against them as I fuck harder and faster.
I bounce on my hand fast. bringing another orgasm on quick.
\nI slow down as I don\'t want to let go yet.\n
I run my thumb over my swollen clit once again which makes me go crazy, thinking my
fingers just isn\'t cutting it anymore, I need something thicker,
longer more like you would be swelled up tight inside my walls.\n


\nI remove my soaking wet fingers from my aching pussy and lick my juices off them before
I reach down and get my toy.
With my toy in hand, I slide into my mouth making it wet.
Thinking in the back of my mind it\'s you, I slide it deep inside my throat,
sucking hard as I would suck your cock, I move in and out of mouth fast a few times,
before I take the pink glistening with salive dildo and trace it down my stomach.\n
I spread my legs as wide as I can raising my ass high on a pillow I slam the toy deep
into my tight pussy,
It stretches my lips open wide and I scream out loud, Gasping for breathe I feel
I am going to cum quick.\n
I move it fast and deep as if I were fucking you, riding you hard.
I arch my back so the toy gets lost deep with in my walls as I am writhing on the bed,
my body shaking and sweat beading along my nipples.
\nI bite my lip as I am getting ready to explode,I slam the toy deep and fast one more time and run my thumb over my clit,
that is all it takes as I can\'t contain it any longer.
\nI start to cum,climaxing to the point of convulsions,
I am screaming out and rocking so hard on the toy my bed is shaking.
My juices are pouring out down the toy onto my hand and soaking the bed underneath me.
I continue to orgasm until there is none left inside me.\n
I slowly ride the toy until I am completely spent and filled with sleep.
I pull the toy out from my tight dripping lips drop it next to
me and curl up with erotic thoughts of you..... With a smile on my face I drift off to sleep
dreaming of what has yet to come.\n\n

My first time Everyone wants their first time to be special,
a moment they can freeze in time to recall and remember forever.\n
I know I still do! My name is Russ and I am a golfer, have been since I was 13.
Back than, golfers weren\'t as cool as they are now,
thanks to Tiger Woods. We usually didn\'t date the cheerleader types.
But I was the lucky one; Lynn was a pretty \"Country Club\" girl that I still
consider her one of the prettiest ladies I know! When
I was 18 I played in our State Open Golf tournament in central California about 100 miles from our hometown.
I asked Lynn\'s parents if she could come along and watch me compete and to both our amazement they agreed.
Don\'t get me wrong, we had been going out for over a year, spending many a fun evening on her parents couch,
kissing and exploring, but we were both still virgins and now we were going on a road trip together.\n

I cared less about that tourney than any golf event I ever competed in. My mind was hoping for one trophy
\nonly and it wouldn\'t be handed out at some ceremony on the 18th green (that is another story for another time, LOL).
The drive north on Highway 101 was exciting, not just because of the anticipation.
I nearly crashed the car once when I missed a stop sign and locked the brakes so hard Lynn fell to the floor.
After checking into the Holiday Inn, we proceeded to our room.\n
Now Lynn was your typical 5\'6\" brunette cheerleader type! Silky skin, blue eyes that sparkled,
the kind of lips that were perfect for kissing and those young pert breasts that the girls had as teenagers.
I knew this already because as I mentioned we had been dating for a
year and we were both each others first true love. While I was no
Robert Redford, at 5\'11\" I did possess the typical California\n

blonde hair blue eyes that most people expect from guys out here.
And I had bought a Porsche 914 with money I had saved working during high school,
so I did have the look and ride going for me. And while I may have been a virgin,
I\'d been sneaking into X-rated theaters for some time.
At first it was the thrill of watching \"dirty movies\",
but it became more about learning what to do when I finally got my chance.
Enough about me and back to that night!
I hadn\'t wanted to pressure Lynn into anything that first night;
I knew we\'d be there for at least 3 more days.\n
So I kept acting like we would simply unpack and go to sleep,
get some much needed rest after the long drive.\n

\nBut once I saw her in her sexy little baby doll I knew sleeping was the last thing on her mind.
We crawled into bed and watched TV for awhile until I couldn\'t take it anymore.
I got out of my bed and leaned towards Lynn and whispered \"Your bed looks much more comfortable than mine,
would you mind sharing it with me?\" Lynn looked a little startled but considered what
I had said and nodded - she looked back to the TV and smiled then nodded again,
seeming more sure this time. Wasting no time, I leaped into the bed and under the covers with her.
In the pale light that was cast from the bathroom down the hall,
I stroked her hair and gazed into her beautiful blue eyes. The TV now forgotten,
I kissed her soft lips and ran my fingers through her long brown hair and then began touching her breasts.
I hesitantly reached for one of the small but perfectly formed breasts,
gently running my fingers in small spirals over the skin and around the nipple.
Lynn\'s sudden intake of breathe only made me braver as I leaned closer and
kissed her gently on the mouth, shyly to start with but quickly developing with more and more passion.
I kissed my way down her body until I got to her tits.\n


\nI flicked my tongue over her dark nipples as Lynn parted her legs and moaned softly.
She arched her back a little, forcing me to take more of her creamy breast into her mouth.
My hands ran softly over Lynn\'s belly, and then up to circle her other breast - lightly pinching the nipple.
Throwing the bed covers off; I momentarily gazed at her beautiful body,
caressing her skin lightly. I trailed my fingertips and nails down her flesh.\n
My cock was fully engorged and I was dying for attention of my own, but it would have to wait.
My long fingers disappeared from view within the folds of Lynn\'s sexy legs.
As I stroked Lynn with regular movements, she tensed,
and arched her back so that most of her body was off of the bed - at this moment
I stuck my fingers deep into the moist flesh, she was panting hard and licked her lips with
rapidly with her soft tongue.\n
I leaned forward and lightly kissed Lynn\'s lips, then pulled back and kissed down her stomach heading
for the soft mound of flesh which I found was trimmed in a very neat little brunette strip. I spread her lips open,
lowered my mouth to her trimmed pussy and ran my tongue along her inner lips.\n
My eyes peered up to watch Lynn\'s facial expressions as I did this. She seemed to be extremely
relaxed and even more aroused. Lynn began to smile, eyes closed, hips wiggling against my face.
Her hands were pushing my mouth against her pussy, obviously wanting me to suck harder on her dripping wet pussy.
Her sex was filling the room...or was it mine? I sucked at her outer folds, licked at her clit, suckling it.
At times, I would fuck Lynn with my tongue and she\'d arch under my mouth,
pushing her breasts up toward her own mouth.\n


\nThen I began fingering her hard clit and slid my finger inside her,
occasionally pulling the finger out and tasting her.
I felt her cunt bearing down on my finger; her g-spot swelling under my constant pressure.
Lynn was really moaning and writhing now and a light sweat was forming on her body.
Her cries filled the small hotel room.\n
I could feel my cock growing against the confines of my
boxer shorts! the pressure was bliss! I moaned softly,
but could not tear my mouth and finger from the dripping pussy before me.
With my left hand, I gently rubbed along the length of my cock through the material adding to
the fantastic pressure.\n
I could tell that my combined assault on her flesh had Lynn on the brink of an explosive orgasm;
she writhed and moaned against the pillows - her hips moving in rhythm to my tongue like she
was fucking my stiff tongue. I patiently coaxed Lynn closer and closer, never rushing her,
letting her decide the exact pace and pressure she needed to bring her to climax. Within a
few minutes, Lynn tensed and pulled my face even tighter against her now sopping wet pussy,
forcing me to suck and lick faster as she tumbled into ecstasy riding my tongue and fingers.
Giving her a minute to recover, I knew my rock hard cock needed some attention now.
I kissed my way back up her stomach,
to her now stiff and swollen nipples.\n

\nAs I sucked on them greedily, I reached down and guided my stiff member to Lynn\'s
wet slit. Gently rubbing the head up and down the juicy folds of her pussy lips,
I slowly slid it into her virgin pussy. Expecting something bloody or painful,
I was surprised at the wet warmth, and how easily I slid my cock inside her.
Her deep guttural moan told me she too, was not feeling any pain, just pleasure.\n

\nAs I began to fuck Lynn more forcefully, my hips slapped against her ass cheeks with every thrust.
I slid my hand down to her clit and it was trapped between our bodies as I masturbated with Lynn.
Her eyes would open, gaze up at me, then moan, and I knew she was enjoying this as much as I was.
I groaned deep in my throat and slowed my pace a little,
wanting really badly to cum but not wanting to end this wonderful feeling.\n
I shuddered and grasped the base of my cock tightly - a little trick I had learned that had
spared my sheets many a time. I held on until the pressure eased enough for me
to start a slow but steady rhythm working my cock in and out of Lynn\'s wet pussy.
It wasn\'t too long before the pressure was building again and the tip of my cock was throbbing like
it would explode at any second, and I knew I wouldn\'t be able to hold out much longer. Finally,
I heard my own cries of ecstasy as I began to shoot my seed into Lynn.
This was enough for her too,her moans became shrill.\n
Unable to control ourselves, and motivated by the
sounds and sensations in our bodies, we began to orgasm. We remained entwined together
for a few minutes until our bodies stopped trembling, then as she laid there
I stroked her hair and searched for something profound to say.\n



\nAll I could manage was \"I love you\" and then I asked her to marry me.
Lynn replied with a breathtaking smile and then kissed me warmly and her
hand slowly stroked my body resting at the base of my neck. We never did get married,
and I missed the \"cut\" at the tournament that week too. But it\'s
still the most memorable evening of my life and it probably always will be.\n\n

\“What would you say to a three-day weekend?\” Lennon asked, and Ivy could have rung his beautiful neck for even suggesting such a thing.
\“Why?\” she asked, turning from the filing cabinet in his private office to face him.
She\’d been digging for something she hadn\’t actually needed,
which she did about five times a day simply to have an excuse to go into Lennon\’s office.\n


\n\“Why? You don\’t say \‘Why?\’ when your boss offers you a three-day weekend. You say, \‘Hell yes, boss.\n
Best idea I\’ve ever heard.\’\”\n
Ivy pursed her lips at him. “\Why?\” she asked again.\n

\n“\You and I both worked all weekend last weekend,\” Lennon said, leaning back in his vintage leather swivel chair.\n
He put his hands behind his head and raised his eyebrows, waiting for her to contradict him.
Ivy envied the hands on his hair. Lennon was a young silver fox, and didn\’t seem to mind at all that he
was mid-thirties and already mostly gray.\n

\n\“No big deal.\” She waved her hand and sat in the club chair across from his desk.
When she crossed her legs, she watched him, hoping he\’d look at her legs.
He did for a split second before meeting her eyes again. \“It\’s not like you didn\’t pay me overtime.\
” And it\’s not like she hadn\’t loved every second of it.
\nWeekend work meant Lennon out of a suit and in jeans and his favorite ratty concert T-shirts.
Saturday had been Pink Floyd. Sunday belonged to Eminem.\n



\nLennon leaned forward, rested his elbows on his desk and looked her in the eyes. Blue eyes, bright but tired.\n

\n\“Katie broke up with me,\” he said.\n

\n\“What? Why?\” Breaking up with Lennon seemed as insane as setting a Rembrandt on fire. Who did that?\n

\n\“This is awkward.\” Lennon wrinkled his face up, and it was as handsome wincing as it was smiling.\n

\n\“Me?\” Ivy asked.\n

\n\“She said I spent more time with my assistant than I do with her.\”\n

\n\“You do.\”\n

\n\“If you weren\’t, you know, you, it wouldn\’t be a problem. But you are you and that\’s a problem. For her, not me.\”\n

\n\“Did you just tell me I\’m pretty?\”\n

\nLennon glared at her. \“You know you are. Katie wouldn\’t care about that if I didn\’t spend my weeks with you and my weekends with you.\n
She says you\’re my work wife.\”\n

\nThen make me your real wife, you beautiful idiot.\n

\n\“So why the three-day weekend? You trying to get rid of me?\” Ivy asked.\n

\n\“Never,\” he said vehemently, and she cherished that vehemence. \“Jack\’s taking me out tomorrow for a recovery day of hiking and drinking.
Then he\’s forcing me entirely against my will to go to a party at a friend\’s house Saturday night.
And if I\’m not here, there\’s no reason for you to be here.\”\n

\n\“Three-day weekend it is then.\” Ivy stood up and smoothed her skirt down. \“And thank you.
I got invited to a party too this weekend,\” she said, a lie. It wasn\’t a party so much as brunch with her sister.
\“Maybe it\’s the same party as yours.\”\n

\nLennon stood up and walked around his desk. Gently he lifted the little gold Star of David pendant she wore on a necklace.
His fingers were so light on her skin she felt goosebumps all over her arms. And Lennon stood so close she could smell his light cologne.\n

\n\“No offense, but I don\’t think you go to the same parties Jack and I go to.
Although if you want to come with us, you can. Beautiful women are always welcome at that house.\” He said it like a dare, like a challenge.\n

\n\“Is it one of those parties?\” Ivy asked as Lennon played with the six-corners of the star.
They were as comfortable with each other as people who worked in close quarters had to be.
She\’d smack his hand when he reached for her food. He\’d let her sleep on his shoulder when they took red-eye flights to London.
But this little moment felt different, felt personal.\n

\n\“One of those parties, yeah…\” He looked a little embarrassed and she adored him for it.
He\’d been careful to keep his personal life separate from his professional life, even with her.\n
But one Sunday afternoon she\’d had to run to his apartment for reasons entirely work-related,
and while he\’d been on the phone in the other room,
she\’d glanced through a half-open door and seen Lennon\’s bedroom.\n
A leather flogger sat on the pillow and handcuffs dangled from the headboard.
\nWhen Lennon had caught her looking he\’d blushed and stammered an apology.
She\’d told him she didn\’t care as long as what he was doing in his free time was consensual.
\nIt had been the first thing she\’d thought of to say and only later had she realized it made her sound boring,
virginal and utterly vanilla.
What she\’d wanted to say was, The handcuffs? The flogger? Lennon, that\’s nothing to apologize for.
It\’s sexy as hell, and I volunteer as your next victim.
There hadn\’t been a night since she hadn\’t fallen asleep dreaming of his body, that bed,
and those handcuffs on her wrists while she made herself come.\n

\nIvy wrapped her hand around his fingers holding her pendant.\n

\n\“Lenn—\”\n

\nLennon let the pendant go like it had burned him.\n

\n\“You work for me,\” he said.\n

\n\“I know. I know.\” She raised her hands in surrender.\n

\nShe knew. She knew.\n
They\’d had this discussion once before on a night flight when neither of them could sleep but seemingly the rest of the plane could.
He\’d admitted his attraction to her, and she to him, and the only thing that had stopped them from joining
the mile-high club had been Lennon\’s innate sense of decency that kept him from sleeping with an employee ten years his junior.
She knew if she made the first move it would happen. But she just couldn\’t bring herself to do it.\n

\nLennon took a step back. She stopped herself from taking a step forward. \“Have a good three-day weekend. I\’ll see you on Monday.\”\n

\nIvy smiled. \“Monday.\”\n

\nThen she took her file, walked out of his office, and sat at her desk. She didn\’t trust herself to walk
back into Lennon\’s office without declaring her love and/or lust for him, so instead she opened their
messenger app and typed, \“Need car service for the party? Where? When?\”\n

\nLennon wrote back thirty seconds later. \“Yes, please. Saturday, nine. 152 Riverside Drive. Warn the driver we\’ll be dressed weird.\”\n

\n\“How weird?\” she typed back.\n

\n\“Eyes Wide Shut weird.\”\n

\n\“I\’ll make a note the comment field.\”\n

\nAnd that\’s when it hit Ivy…she knew where the party was. She knew when it was. She knew she could go to it if she wanted to go to it.\n

\nShe wanted to go to it.\n

\nLennon had said \“Eyes Wide Shut weird\” and implied he’d be dressed in some sort of costume. That would make it much easier to slip in and out.
She didn\’t want to do anything but see him, and be part of his world for a little while.
She wouldn\’t even talk to him. But to pass unobserved she’d have to dress the part herself.
Saturday morning she made an appointment with her stylist who did her hair in a complicated and very un-Ivy updo.
She bought a slinky white dress and a white masquerade mask. Lennon had never seen her wear her hair like this.
He\’d never seen her wear white. And with the mask covering half her face, he’d have no idea it was her.
Since it was one of \“those\” parties, Ivy also invested in a pair of white seamed stockings and a garter
belt and white high heels with white ribbons that tied at the ankle. Once dressed she looked the opposite of her usual work self.
Her own mother wouldn\’t recognize her.\n

\nWhen nine o\’clock rolled around, she grabbed a cab.\n
On her way there she told herself that if the party wasn\’t her scene, all she had to do was turn around and leave.
She could do this. Get in, get out, don\’t cause trouble. Don\’t reveal herself and whatever she did, no contact with Lennon. None.
\n

\nThe cab dropped her off, and she paid her driver.\n
It took her a couple seconds to work up the courage to step out and climb the stairs of the black-and-white three-story townhouse.
Through the door she could hear the sounds of music and laughter and the usual party revelry going on inside.
Before she knocked she tried the knob and found the door unlocked. As quickly and quietly as she could, Ivy stepped inside.\n

\nOh.\n\n

Oh…\n\n

Oh, no.\n\n

Lennon hadn\’t been exaggerating. It really was one of those kinds of parties.\n\n

Everywhere she looked she saw couples coupling. Kissing in doorways,\n
draped over each other on sofas and in the room to the left, some sort of sitting room,
she saw a woman kneeling on her hands and knees on a coffee table while a man in a dark three-piece suit and devil horns fucked her from behind.
They weren\’t alone in the room, not at all. People stood around watching, cheering.
Someone even held a stopwatch in his hand. Cash was scattered on the table around the woman\’s hands and knees.
From what Ivy could tell it was a contest and The Devil was contestant number two.
The previous contestant had fucked the woman twelve minutes and sixteen seconds before coming.
The current contestant just fucked his way past the ten minute mark. Someone in the crowd said they were neck in neck.\n\n
Someone else said they were cock in cock.

Ivy stared, mesmerized by the scene. It was porn—beautiful, erotic, playful live porn—and she couldn\’t look away.
Her nipples tightened under her low-cut dress and her pussy swelled at the sight of the
woman taking the cock so casually in a room of a dozen people.\n
Ivy flushed and felt herself growing wet, and her vagina clenched at nothing, wanting something inside it.\n\n

\“Want to play?\” came an accented voice from behind her. She turned and saw the man who\’d spoken.\n
He wore a military-style long coat, white shirt open at the collar, plus breeches and Hessian boots polished to a high shine.
He was impossibly handsome, with shoulder-length, dark, wavy hair and a wolfish gleam in his dark eyes.\n\n

\“I…no. Just watching,\” she said.\n\n

\“I shouldn\’t play anyway,\” he said with a dramatic sigh. \“I always win.
Hardly fair, is it?\” He lifted her hand to his lips at if to kiss the back of it.
Instead he flipped her hand over and pressed his lips to the center of her palm.
With a wink he walked away, no doubt seeking out more amenable prey.\n\n

Ivy turned to leave and came face to bare chest with a man wearing nothing but leather pants.\n
Nothing. Not even shoes. He had shaggy hair, brown skin and a wicked smile. She felt a sudden pang of attraction to him.\n\n

\“Oh, sorry,\” she said. \“I—\”\n\n

\“You must be new,\ he said, narrowing his eyes at her.\n\n

\“I\’m very new. Very, very new.\”\n\n

\“We like newbies around here.\” He cupped her chin. \“Tell me what you want, and I\’ll make sure you get it.\”\n\n

Ivy opened her mouth, closed it, then saw Lennon striding down the hallway toward the front door.
He wasn\’t dressed nearly as oddly as everyone else at the party.\n
He had on black trousers, a black vest, and a white shirt with the cuffs rolled to his elbows.
His only nod to the party atmosphere was the black mask he wore over his eyes. Impossible not to know it was him, however.
Not with that smile and that salt-and-pepper hair.\n\n

\“Him,\” Ivy whispered. \“I want him.\”\n\n

\“You sure about that?\” the man in the leather pants asked. She couldn\’t believe she\’d spoken her wish aloud.\n\n

\“I am.\”\n\n

\“Then kiss me.\”\n\n

Ivy kissed the stranger and found his mouth warm and his lips skillful.\n
She\’d been so busy with work for Lennon she hadn\’t gone on a date in six months.
Whoever this man was, she didn\’t know, but she also didn\’t care. He had big hands that felt good on her waist,
and a girl needed kissing sometimes.
Even by a stranger.\n\n

And then Ivy was off her feet. Entirely, completely and totally off her feet, being carried over the man\’s shoulder.\n\n

\“Oh my God,\” she said, and the man heard her.\n\n

\“I\’m a firefighter in real life,\” he said, slapping her on the ass. \“Trust me, I know what I\’m doing.\”\n

\“Glad one of us does.\”\n\n

\“Come on, man,\” he said as he carried her into a room. \“I caught something for you.\”\n\n

\“Aw, you shouldn\’t have, Jack.\” Ivy recognized Lennon\’s voice.\n\n

\“You\’ve had a hard week. You\’ve earned some fun.\”\n\n

So this was Jack, Lennon\’s kinky friend who dragged him to parties? Is this something they did together? Share women?\n
Ivy wanted to be jealous if it was, but instead she found the prospect arousing, the thought of being passed back and forth between them.\n\n

Ivy gripped the sofa cushion hard and tried to get her bearings.\n
She was in a room, a very nice but small room with antique furniture like out of Pride and Prejudice or something.
Door closed. No lights on but for the fire burning in the fireplace. No bed. Fireplace with an ornate, dark-wood mantel and a low fire burning.
Other than the couch she and Jack sat on, there was one armchair across from them and a huge steamer trunk that acted as a coffee table.
Lennon sat in the chair and held his wine glass lightly between his fingertips. He was watching her.\n\n

\“This is how it works,\” Jack was saying as he slowly eased her panties down her legs.\n
\“Since you\’re new…I do whatever I want to do to you and you say \‘Red\’ when and if you want me to stop.
And what I want to do to you is fuck you while my friend watches. Then he will do whatever he wants to do you.
He won\’t be nearly as gentle with you as I will. Yes? No? Red?\”\n\n

Ivy glanced at Lennon, who grinned at Jack’s warning.\n\n

She was scared, her heart pounding, her blood pumping so hard in her ears it sounded like the roar of an ocean.\n

\“Yes.\”

She whispered the word so Lennon couldn\’t recognize her voice. But Jack heard.\n\n

\“Good answer,\” he said, and casually unzipped his pants to pull out his cock.\n\n

He reached for a condom from the bowl of them on the steamer trunk.\n
She couldn\’t believe this was happening as he stroked himself to his full hardness and rolled on the condom so\n
matter-of-factly he could have been tying his shoes if he\’d been wearing any.\n\n

\“You can say \‘Red\’ anytime,\” Lennon said from his armchair. \“We\’re big boys. We have self-control.\”\n

Ivy nodded her understanding, taking comfort in his words. It made it easier when Jack pushed her legs wide open.
Out of the corner of her eye she could see Lennon leaning forward, lifting his chin to see her better.
Since she\’d gotten a full wax yesterday, she knew he could see everything—her open labia, her clitoris,
her wetness—and it aroused her even more to know Lennon was seeing her body without even knowing it was hers.
Jack inserted his index finger into her and rubbed along the walls of her vagina.\n\n

\“New and eager,\” Jack said with a dirty grin, clearly impressed by how wet she was. She realized quickly he wasn\’t talking to her, but Lennon.
\“I\’ll open her up for you. You finish her off. Sound like a plan?\”\n\n

Lennon answered, \“A perfect plan.\”\n\n

Jack gripped her by the back of the knees and knelt between her thighs.\n
This was happening…it was actually happening…Ivy breathed quick, shallow breaths to calm herself. It didn\’t work.
Jack had his cock in his hand, and the tip pushed against her clitoris.
A spasm of pleasure shot through her, and Ivy instinctively lifted her hips to offer herself to him.
With one smooth stroke he was inside her.
He pushed her dress up to her stomach, gripped her waist and rode her with firm steady thrusts.
She couldn\’t believe she was doing this, letting a strange man fuck her while her boss watched.
She lifted her head and watched Jack\’s cock pumping in and out of her. No denying it—she was doing this.
Her head fell back on the sofa and she turned toward Lennon. She didn\’t mean to meet his eyes but as soon as she did, she couldn\’t look away.
See me…she wanted to say to him. Look at me.
I\’m not who you think I am. I\’m not just your assistant. I’m a woman, and I need you like this…He saw her.
Those blue eyes of his never left hers as Jack fucked her. If only he knew her, knew it was her.
It\’s me…she told him with her eyes. It\’s Ivy, and I want you enough I did this for you, to be with you…\n\n

Jack was fucking her hard now, and Ivy opened her legs wider for him.
Lennon moved from the chair and sat on the steamer trunk next to them.
She wasn\’t ready for him to touch her, but touch her he did, pressing his hand onto her lower stomach
and pushing down as if trying to feel Jack\’s cock moving inside her.
Then Lennon dipped his fingertips into his white wine and touched her clitoris with them.
She inhaled sharply, nearly flinching at the sudden coolness on her burning body.
He grinned as he rubbed the swollen knot of flesh, toying with it at first before giving it the serious attention it needed.
Her hips moved in tight circles as Lennon touched her and Jack fucked her. All sensation was concentrated in her pelvis, in her sex.
Lennon worked her clitoris with two fingers and it more than she could take.
This man she adored and lusted after touching her so intimately while she was being fucked…she came with a cry and a shudder,
her hole gripping and grabbing at Jack\’s cock still pounding her. He slammed his orgasm into her as Ivy lay back, closed her eyes and took it.

\n\nShe was empty inside again and her body felt warm and drowsy. Somewhere she heard a door open and close.
Ivy was being lifted into strong arms.
Limp and spent, she let the strong arms pull her upright and press her into the back of the couch.
Thighs nudged her legs open and someone penetrated her again.
Ivy opened her eyes and found herself in Lennon\’s arms, her chin on his shoulder, her legs wound around his waist, as he pinned her to
the back of the couch with his cock inside her.\n\n

His hands were on her back, lowering the zipper on her dress. She stiffened, suddenly wide awake.\n\n

\“We\’re alone,\” Lennon said, kissing her bare shoulder as he slid the straps of her dress down her arms.
Down, down it went until he’d pushed her dress to her waist, baring her breasts for him. \“Don\’t be shy.\”\n\n

Shy? She was finally having sex with the man she\’d adored for two years. Ivy leaned back, arching for him, offering her breasts to him.
He ran his hands over them, squeezing them lightly, holding them in his palms as he licked and sucked her nipples.
Lennon was sucking her nipples and it felt better than anything had ever felt in her life.
Fucking her softly at first, deeply, and then harder and harder.
Jack had warned her Lennon would be rougher with her than he was.\n
But Jack hadn\’t warned her it would feel this good.\n
He was fucking her so hard now she could feel it in her stomach.
She loved it, needed it, had needed it ever since she went to work for Lennon.
He pulled out of her but only to turn her, bending her over the sofa arm.
He entered her from behind and fucked her deep, his hands holding her breasts and squeezing them, tugging the nipples until she moaned.\n\n

\“You like this?\” he asked, and his voice sounded so unlike him. So forceful and dominant.\n\n

“Yes.”\n\n

\“When I\’m done fucking you I\’m going to flog you. Then fuck you again. You want that?\”\n\n

\“Yes.\” She was so wet from his thrusts she felt it dripping down her thighs.\n\n

\“I knew you would.\”\n\n

But how did he know? He didn\’t even know it was her.\n\n

He didn\’t know…\n\n

\“Red,\” Ivy said.\n\n

Lennon pulled out of her immediately as Ivy yanked her dress back up.\n\n

\“What\’s wrong?\” he asked, looking scared, concerned. He touched her arm. \“I didn\’t hurt you, did I?\”\n

\“No,\” she said, scrambling off the sofa. \“I\’m sorry.\”\n\n

He reached for her again as she headed for the door, but she kept walking away from him and out of the house.\n\n

What was she thinking, having sex with her own boss without telling him it was her? Jack knew he was having\n
anonymous sex with a girl he’d never met before. But Lennon didn\’t, and that wasn\’t right.
No matter how much she wanted him, how good it felt, it wasn\’t right.\n\n

By Monday morning, Ivy had pulled herself together as best as she could.\n
She dressed in her normal clothes, did her hair the normal way, prepared to act as normally as she could.
She wouldn’t blow her cover.
She wouldn\’t confess. She wouldn\’t put Lennon in a horribly awkward position because she’d followed him to his party like some lovesick puppy.
She would be a grown-up and carry the secret.
In the break room she poured two cups of coffee and marched into his office like it was any other day.\n\n

\“Morning,\” she said, handing him his coffee.\n\n

\“How was your weekend?\”\n\n

\“Good. Yours?\” Ivy asked, keeping her face empty of expression.\n\n

\“Good. Too short.\”\n\n

\“Typical, right?\”\n\n

\“Right. But back to work. Can you bring me the Close Brothers file?\”\n\n

She walked to the filing cabinet and opened the top drawer. When she pulled out the file, something fell out onto the floor.\n\n

Ivy bent to pick it up and found a black mask in her hand.\n\n

She looked at it, then looked at Lennon who was smiling smugly at her with his hands clasped behind his head.\n\n

\“You tan easily, you know,\” he said.\ “But your Star of David pendant blocks the sun. You have a six-pointed pale spot on your chest.\”\n\n

\“You knew it was me?\”\n\n

\“The whole time…\”\n\n

\“I didn\’t mean to. Jack was there and he asked me what I wanted and I said you.
What\’s going to happen?\” Ivy\’s heart pounded outside her chest, the mask clutched in her hand, memories of his mouth on her
breasts and his fingers on her clitoris setting her to blushing and flushing and burning inside and out.\n\n

Lennon stood up and walked over to her. As he passed the door, he closed it and locked it.\n\n

\“What would you say to a four-day weekend?\” he asked. Before she could answer he dipped his head and kissed her slow and deep and long,
his tongue touching hers, his hands on her lower back and roaming lower, and his hips pushing into hers.
She pulled back from the kiss and stared up at him. He knew. And she knew. And they\’d done it anyway.
And now they were going to do it again.\n\n

\“I would say…Hell yes, boss. Best idea I\’ve ever heard.\”\n\n

My First Blowjob Hello. My name is Christin, and the thing I like to do most is suck cock.
There probably aren\'t a whole lot of girls out there who enjoy it as much as I do.
I\'m going to tell you about the first blowjob I ever gave, which was also the best one.
It was while I was at school during lunch time that I gave my first blowjob.
 I remember every little detail like it was just yesterday.
I was 15 at the time, and I did know about sex and all the different ways it was administered.
I sat down at my usual table, right next to the new guy that had just moved in from New York.
He was really cute, and seemed pretty nice to me.\n\n

We talked for a couple of minutes, and then he asked me if there was any place I knew of that we could be alone.
I took him to one of my favorite places in the whole school.
It was behind a couple of trees and some bushes where I used to do my homework and talk with friends.
No one could see us there, and a few of my friends and
I were the only ones who knew about it.
Then he immeadiately asked me if I had ever given a blowjob.
 I said I hadn\'t, seeing as it was the truth.\n\n


I told him I might be interested, because I had never seen a guy\'s you know what in real life before.
He looked happy, and started to unzip his pants.
When his clothes were gone, I found myself looking at a large hairy cock.
I took it in my hands and started playing with it, feeling how soft it was.
Even though I didn\'t know it at the time, I made him extremely horny.
His cock began to grow and grow.\n\n

I gasped when it finally stopped. He was huge! He said it would really make him happy if I gave head to him.
I said I would because I was afraid that if I didn\'t he might not like me anymore.
 He laid down on the ground, and I got on top of him.
I wrapped my hands around his enormous cock, and began to stroke it gently.
I placed my tounge just under his head, and moved it all the way down to his balls.
I started moving my tounge in circles around the head of his warm cock, and he started to moan.
I put his head in my mouth and slowly started to suck on him.\n\n


I began to move down, sliding more and more of his pulsing cock into my mouth.
I felt his head at the back of my mouth and kept on going. His cock seemed to go on for ever.
I still had about 2 inches left and then he couldn\'t stand it any longer and shoved the remainder
down my throat.\n
I could feel his head throbbing far far inside my throat,
and it was the best feeling in the world.\n\n



I wanted to suck his cock for the rest of my life, because it tasted so good and felt so wonderful.
I slowly began to move my mouth up and down on his hard cock.
I increased in speed until I could go no faster.\n
His pounding cock flew in and out of my mouth, and I licked and sucked everything in sight.
 My tounge moved all over his cock, covering every single inch of it, and I still wanted more.
Then I felt the cock inside my mouth stiffen. I knew this was the moment.
A huge surge of cum flew up the length of his cock and spewed all into my mouth.
I savored the taste for a few seconds, and then swallowed it down, hungry for more.
I was drinking it down as fast as he could give it to me.\n\n


When I was satisfied that I had drained him completely, I slowly moved up off of his cock,
sucked his head, and licked the remaining cum off of his still throbbing cock. He let out a sigh of
relief and told me that was the best thing anyone had ever done for him.
 I told him how much I enjoyed it, and that we needed to do it again sometime.
He agreed. But that\'s another story.....\n\n

PASSION This vacation was turning out to be a disaster, no, that wasn\'t quite right,
more like a big disappointment, but however you described it, Melinda was wishing that
she was back home in the states rather than being alone in even such an exotic location
as Naples!!! The food was great, the sights were even better, but she was just so
damned lonely she could hardly stand it, because after having lived with Josh for
the past three years, their break up had almost crushed her spirit!!!
Her best friend Lorie had recommended taking a long European vacation to take her
mind off of her troubles, \nbut while she should have been enjoying herself,
all she could think about was how much she missed him and how she wished she
was back in Chicago where she could at least plot to win him back!!! That night back in her
hotel it was the same as the three nights before, dinner in the hotel restaurant,
a drink at the bar, and up to bed to cry herself to sleep, which was not exactly
what the travel brochures advertised, so after tomorrow morning\'s sight seeing expedition
she would call the airline and make a reservation for an early return flight back home!!!
The first thing she noticed about him was his dazzling white smile, the kind that lit up
a room, and the next thing was his laugh, so easy and gentle,\n
yet the kind that made you want to laugh along with him because it made you so happy!!!
How she ended up down by the water front while the rest of the group was touring the city\'s
main cathedral she\'ll never know, but the olive skinned young man with the beautiful
smile was making a pass at her and while she tried to fight it,\n
she couldn\'t help but enjoy the feeling of being pursued, after all,
it had been a long time!!! \"You are American, no,\" he asked softly while staring
straight into her eyes as if he was trying to see deep inside of her!?! \"Uh yes, I\'m an American,\"
she replied shyly, \"are you a a native of Naples!?!\" \"But of course,\" he
replied smoothly,\"and how do you like our city!?!\" \"It\'s the most beautiful city I\'ve
ever seen,\" she replied slightly red faced, \"with the volcano and all,
it\'s very romantic!!!\" \"It is a city for lovers,\" he answered, \"you know the saying,
see Naples and die, but I might add not to quickly!!!\" They both giggled at his little
joke before he asked, \"And what is your name!?!\" \"My name is Melinda, Melinda Knight,\"
she replied,\"and what\'s yours!?!\" \"My name is Antonio, but of course everyone calls me
Tony,\" he replied, \"would you do me the pleasure of boarding my boat!?!\" This was it,
a very handsome Italian man with a forty foot power boat asking her to come aboard,
if she did, who knows where it might lead, and really, was she ready for something like this,
especially since she was in such a fragile state of mind!!! She looked at the boat and back at
Tony who was standing there holding out his hand to help her on board, and after taking a deep
breath she took his hand an climbed on!!! Still holding onto her hand he led her up the
stairs to the helm, and after warming up the twin diesels for a few minutes,
he put her into gear and headed out of the harbor into the bright blue Mediterranean
for a ride!!! With the wind in her face and the waves crashing against the
hull as they powered out to sea, she felt and exhilaration she hadn\'t felt in a
long long time!!! \"This is quite a boat,\" she commented to Tony, \"is it really yours!?!\"
He gave her hand a little squeeze and again came that infectious laugh and re replied,
\"If I told you I stole it would you be afraid!?!\" \"Y-you didn\'t steal it,
did you,\" she stammered while a stab of fear shot through her!?! \"Maybe,\" he teased,
\"but only from my father, it is our family\'s craft,\n
but I can assure you that he doesn\'t mind that I\'m using it, especially with such a
beautiful young woman, in fact he would be quite proud of me!!!\" Melinda
blushed uncontrollably at that last remark, but whether she liked it or not,
it felt more that good to have a man make flattering comments about her appearance,\n\n


something that Josh hadn\'t done in months!!! When they were a good twenty miles off shore,
Tony dropped the anchor and announced, \"The water is warm, we will go for a swim, follow me!!!\" A pang of
panic struck her, but Melinda followed Tony to the rear of the boat where he casually stripped off all of
his clothing and dived into the crystal clear water where he treaded water and yelled, \"Come on in,
I am waiting for you!!!\" \"What about a suit,\" she asked dumbly while staring at his
wonderful body in the clear blue water!?! \"You American\'s are so modest,\" he said with a
laugh, \"there is no suit, Melinda, just take off your dress and join me!!!\" After
giving it one last thought, \nMelinda looked to the heavens for help, and shucked her dress,
panties, and bra, and after a moments hesitation, she dove into the warm water and swam over
to Tony!!! \"You have a beautiful body,\" he whispered after taking her into his arms
and holding her close to him, \"making love to you will be like making love to a goddess!!!\"
Even though the water was very warm, she shivered at the way he spoke of making love to her,
and when his hand roamed casually between her legs and onto her bulging mons,
she offered no resistance at all!!! His kiss while passionate,\n
was delicate and sweet, the kind that melted a woman\'s heart and made her
glad that she was a female, so when he gently shoved her towards the boat,
she was more than ready to go!!! It had been almost a month since she had felt the body of a
man close to her, and her pent up passion over flowed as their bodies pressed together in an
embrace and kiss that made her drench with anticipation of his organ!!! \"My my,\" he
chuckled at her exuberance, \"we have all day,\n Melinda Knight, take your time, savor the moment!!!\"
He was right, of course, but her raw sexual energy had bubbled to the
surface and nothing her could do or say could hold her back now,\n
and like a lioness in heat, she found his manhood and slid it easily inside of her,
while she mounted and rode him like a bitch in heat, which is exactly what she was!!!
To be filled with a man again, exquisite, the feeling of being a woman,
it was more than wonderful, riding a man until you couldn\'t stand it anymore,
grinding your vagina onto his spike until his sperm erupted inside of you,
that was how she felt as she rode him to an all consuming orgasm that left them
both breathless and shattered on the deck of the gently rolling boat!!!
When he was finally able to speak, he whispered softly, \"That was more than making love,
it was as though you were possessed by a force out of your control!!!\"
She kissed his smooth chest and replied softly, \"I\'m sorry, but it had been so long for me,
I-I just lost my head, please forgive me, I promise I\'ll make
it up to you!!!\" \"And how would you do that,\" he asked good naturedly!?!
After kissing him softly of the mouth,\n
she looked him in the eye and replied, \"Like this,\" while sliding down to his groin and
taking him gently into her mouth!!!\" He gasped at her initial contact with his cock,
but soon he was holding her head in his hands an urging her to suck him even harder!!!
He had been with many women from all over the world, and while the French had the reputation,
no one gave head like the Americans, because with them it was a passion not a duty,
and Melinda Knight was American through and through!!! For the rest of the day they swam,
made love, and ate on the beautiful boat that lay anchored in the blue waters
just off the western Italian coast!!! Tony\'s bronze body was in complete contrast to Melinda\'s
pale Nordic perfection, and it seemed, at least for that day, they were indeed
consumed with each other!!! That night they as they lay in each other\'s arms,
Tony kissed her cheek and asked, \"How long will you be staying in Naples!?!\"
For the past three hours she had been thinking about that herself,\n
and after a moments thought she asked, \"When would you want me to go back, Tony!?!\"
He cocked his eye and asked, \"Are you asking if it were up to me!?!\" She
kissed his cheek and replied softly, \"You don\'t have to answer
that if you don\'t want to, I didn\'t mean to put you on the spot, I\'m sorry,
in answer to your question, my reservations are for this Saturday!!!\"
His had was running up and down her bare back, each time caressing her full bottom,
and after pausing to feel her roundness he whispered, \"I-I don\'t want you to go!!!\" With
his hand on her ass and the way he was talking, she immediately felt her vagina softly
convulse and her breathing become shallow as she stammered, \"Y-you want me to
staywhere!?!\" \"Why, with me of course,\" he whispered back to her, \"are you afraid!?!\" \"No,\"
she gasped as he rolled her over onto her back and mounted and entered
her roughly, \"oh, oh, ohhhhhhhh, my!!!\" Never in her life had she
had so many orgasms as she had that day with Tony,\n
and for once she was with a man who shared her passion and was ready to give it
back to her in kind!!! As he rammed his thickness in and out of her eager vagina,
she wrapped her legs around his tight ass, locking him in place,
the place she desired he\'d be for the rest of her life!!! In their post coital haze,
Melinda traced little hearts on Tony\'s chest and asked softly, \"I know that you were
under the spell of excitement, but did you mean it, I mean what
you said earlier about me staying with you!?!\" Even though it had only been ten
minutes or so since they had made love, she could feel his manhood pressing again,
insistently against her flat belly, and as they both looked down at it,
she knew she had her answer!!!\n\n

A friend We had been friends for a long time, long enough that we knew each others likes and dislikes
and many other things. So we were enjoying another weekend visit between families.
Clear skies, cool air, warm sunshine, and a motorcycle parked in the garage motivated me to ask for a ride.
That and time alone with you.\n
With permission from all, we started out on our little trek. The wind on my face,
the warmth of your back, and the vibrations between my legs were adding up to an incredible afternoon.
As the road passed by my mind wandered to the many times we had teased each other
unmercifully, sly comments, private jokes, passing caresses, all came flooding
back and the vibrations between my legs became more than the thrum of the bike.
I slid as close to you as possible and slipped my hands up your back, across your shoulders,
touching as much of you as possible around jackets and safety issues.
Finally when I slid my hands around and down, you realized where my trip was taking us.
You pulled down a small back road that you knew and parked the bike.
After pulling off helmets and jackets and gloves,
I gave you a look that left no doubts as to what I wanted and needed.
I guided your hand to the waistband of my pants and said simply, "Please!"
No further encouragement was needed as your fingers played down my stomach and found how hot,
wet, and ready I was. You started to tease me,
rubbing slowly, playing me out, but I was to far gone from
all the other stimulations of the ride.\n\n

I begged you to finger fuck me,hard! Not able to refuse my request you plunged your strong fingers into
my smooth cunt in one thrust and then set out on a rhythm that pushed me to the edge.
Knowing this, you started a steady massage of my clit that had me breathless and coming in seconds.
When I came down from that high, I pulled your hand to my mouth and sucked your
fingers clean of my cum. Now you were near the same state as I had been when we stopped.
After shedding my clothes, I knelt down next to you and pulled your jeans out of my way.
Your cock was thick with your desire and I gladly began action to bring you relief.
I slid my tongue up and down your length and around your balls, taking in the taste and smell of you,
enjoying the textures until you grabbed my hair and groaned.\n
Taking the cue I sucked your cock into my mouth, slightly grazing with teeth,
and stroking with my tongue along your complete length. I let you guide the motion,
holding my hair and guiding my mouth to fuck your cock at the speed you preferred.
Following my suit, you spilled your release quickly and I licked you clean of your cum this time.\n\n


In the process of licking you clean, your cock grew back to attention and our thoughts turned together to new pursuits.
Pulling me up from the grass, you turned me around and began an exploration of my body,
touching my face, smoothing my shoulders , reaching around to cup my breasts and pinch my nipples.
Then you had me bend over using the bike for support.
You stepped back to take in the view of my ass in the air with all of me exposed to your sight,
touch, and taste.\n
Grabbing me by the hips, you began a thorough tonguing of my lower back and my ass,
ending with a trip down to my soaked cunt for a taste and to torture my clit.
After assuring that I was totally ready for more, you stood and introduced your cock to my cunt in one swift motion.
It felt incredible and you proceeded to make the introduction a thorough one. With our prior relief,
we were able to enjoy your cock penetrating me at varying speeds and strengths, at one point,
moaning at the pleasure of a slow steady stroking, at another shouting my pleasure as you rammed powerfully into me.
I was left fully open to whatever you wanted to do with me.\n
We drew out our enjoyment for as long as possible, but always the feel of
hardness against softness drove us both back to the edge and over again.
After our trembling subsided, I again took you into my mouth, savoring the taste our mutual enjoyment.
Realizing how long we had been gone, we helped each other dress and sealed the afternoon with kisses and soft words,
then we settled ourselves back on the bike for the ride home.\n
The vibrations brought lingering pleasure and thoughts of more rides to come.
What better way to spend an afternoon.\n\n

Erin let her hand roam over Vanna\'s tight ass as the two lesbian lovers kissed\n
passionately underneath the stinging rays of their morning shower!!! The two women couldn\'t have been more different,
with Erin tall and lean with almost a dancer\'s body, perfect 36B cup breasts and short blonde hair that framed her
beautiful face, while Vanna was much shorter, and not quite fat, she certainly was on the chubby
side with her 38DD breasts and wide plump bottom coupled with a nice round tummy that capped her wildly
hairy dark brunette vagina!!! Both girls appreciated the others attributes as Erin would have killed for Vanna\'s
big chest, while on the other hand just once Vanna would like to slip into a perfect size six
dress instead of her usual size twelve!!! As the intensity of their kiss grew,\n
automatically each one slipped a finger into the others vagina and quickly frigged her to a stunning orgasm,
leaving them both shaken and satiated before leaving for work!!! After leaving the apartment building arm in arm,
they gave each other a quick peck on the cheek,\n\n


and then went off in opposite directions on there way to work!!!
Erin sat quietly on the bus reading the morning paper,
but try as she might she couldn\'t keep her mind on her reading as a gnawing ache which
had been slowly building for weeks bubbled to the surface, \ndampening her
vagina and flushing her cheeks to a bright shade of red!!! This was a side of her that she
hated and abhorred, but as in the past she knew that until she received gratification
she would be in a constant state of sexual arousal, making even the simplest of tasks nearly impossibe!!! She
got off the bus a half a block from work, and while normally she would have enjoyed
the crowds of people and the hustle and bustle of Chicago\'s Loop, today was different as she labored
making it to her office building without stopping to press her thighs together in order to
relieve some of the tension building like a tsunami inside of her smoothly shaved cunt!!! When she finally
ploppd down at her desk, literally out of breath from the experience,\n
she picked up the phone and dialed a number she had written on the back page of her address book,
a number that had no name by it, only a question mark!!! She waited impatiently while the phone rang five,
six, seven, eight times, until on the ninth ring a sleepy voice picked up the receiver and said tiredly, \"This had
better be good, now, whattaya need!?!\" After finishing up her conversation,\n
Erin got up and made her way to her boss\'s office, and after knocking on the door jam to
announce her presence, she stuck her head inside and asked, \"Mike, I have some personal
business that I have to attend to right away this morning, do you mind of I take the next two hours, I\'ll be
back by eleven!?!\" Her boss looked up from the report he was reading from the Asian office and asked seriously,
\"You\'e not sick are you, please tell me that you\'re okay, I can\'t afford to have you\n\n



out of the office for any length of time, you know we\'ve go the Broadman presentation
next week!?!\" \"Not to worry,\" she replied brightly, \"this has nothing to do with my health,
it\'s just something that came up, so after I get back let\'s meet for lunch, okay,
and then we can plan our strategy for that presentation!!!\" Just glad that he wasn\'t losing his number one
trouble shooter to a long absence, he waved her away with a nod and went back reading the report,
while Erin on the other hand, practically sprinted for the elevators!!! While it would have been cheaper
to take the bus or train, since time was of the essense,\n
Erin hailed a Yelow Cab and gave an address on the near north
side to the middle eastern driver and then collapsed back in her seat,
while nervously crossing and uncrossing her pretty legs!!! \"That\'ll be three twenty five,\"
the driver said after stopping in front of a well kept graystone in the middle of the
block!!! Erin tossed a fiver through the
open window onto his lap and said while already heading up the walk to the front
door,\n \"Keep the change and don\'t wait, and thanks!!!\" Before she had gone even ten feet,
the cab roared away searching for another fare, while Erin hopped up the
front stoop and rang the bell for the second floor!!!\n
The large carved oak door had an almost gothic look to it, and Erin shivered while waiting to buzzed in, a
nd even though it was only a moment or two before the buzzer rang, she still pressed her
thighs together and actually moaned softly as the heat in her
vagina was beginning to burn out of control!!! As she made her way to the second floor apartment, a
very tall woman appeared at the top of the stairs and announced, \"It\'s so very good to see you again,
Erin, are we in just a tiny bit of need this morning!?!\" Puffing slightly\n\n

by the time she reached the top landing, Erin nodded to the regal looking lady, and in a soft voice replied,
\"You know how I get, please don\'t make fun of me, Victoria!!!\" \"Suit yourself,\" she replied after
closing the door behind them and ushering Erin into the well appointed living room,
\"but you femmes just kill me, for four or five months everything\'s hunkydory,\n
but then when the need grows too intense you have to come to Veronica to make it all better!!!\" \"I\'ve
got to get back to the office,\" Erin replied softly, \"so if we could get
started..........\"\n
\"Spinning around quickly, Veronica gave Erin the back of her
hand right across her cheek, and in an almost evil voice spat,\n
\"Don\'t you ever tell what to do again, you little cunt, do you got it!?!\"
Tears immediately welled up in Erin\'s eyes while she rubbed her burning cheek,
but she still managed to stammer in a weak voice, \"I-I undertstand, Veronica, I\'ll be a good girl,
I promise!!! With a haughty superior look on her face,
Veronica literally sneered at Erin and replied, \"That, my little girl, remains to be seen!!!\"
Now leading the shaken woman into the bedroom,\n\n


Veronica shoved Erin onto the king size bed and ordered, \"Take it all off, bitch,
and show me what you\'ve got!!!\" With her hands shaking from fear and excitement Erin quickly
removed all of her clothing until she was lying maked on the bed with her legs slightly spread
and ready to go!!! \"Humph,\" Veronica snorted, \"I\'d almost forgotten what pitiful breasts you have,
a ten year old would have more than this,\" while reaching out and grabbing a nipple between her
fingers and twisting it harshly, making Erin gasp with pain!!! \"Oh, you like that do you,\" Veronica asked while
twisting the poor nipple all the harder, \"tell me now, does that little slut you call a roomate
take care of you like me!?!\" \"Oh no,\" Erin moaned, \"s-she\'s nothing like you!!!\"
Veronica grabbed Erin\'s other nipple in her other hand and after vicously twisting it too,
said harshly.\n\n

\"I don\'t like the way you said that, you made it sound like you like her
better than me!!!\" The fury building in Erin\'s pussy was now raging like a steel mill\'s smelter,
and as her first orgasm was engulfing her cunt, she moaned loudly, \"O-oh no,
no one is as good as you are, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh god I\'m already cumming!!!\"\n
Veronica had to smile to herself while watching the young femme cumming without her even
having touched her pussy, but as Erin\'s orgasm faded, Veronica lifted her own skirt and
exposed a brutal looking strap on dildo that hung menacingly from her groin!!! \"Is this what my little pussy wants,\"
Veronica asked in a little girl\'s voice, \"does she need the big bad cock to
fill her tight little shaved pussy!?!\" Erin\'s eyes had now glazed over as she greedily
reached for the ten inch satisfier, only to be disappointed when Veronica stepped back,
just out of her reach!!!\" \"Please,\" Erin begged while now vigorously fingering her
pussy, \"y-you know how I get, let me have it please!!!\n
\" \"I\'ve always wondered about that,\" Veronica said a matter of factly,\
"why you always come to me when you need some cock when all you\'d have to do is get man to
fuck you once in awhile!!!\" \"I couldn\'t do that,\" Erin gasped while staring at the thick piece of
latex gently saying from side to side just out of her reach, \"I want you to fuck me, not a man!!!\" \"Of course you do,
dear,\" Veronica replied softly, \" but first you have to do something for me!!!\"
Erin was now in such a state of delirium that she would have probably blown a monkey if Veronica had told her to,
but when the tall black haired bitch lifted the dildo out of the way, exposing her now drooling pussy,
Erin knew exactly what to do as she scrambled to the floor and buried her mouth into Veronica\'s hot slit!!! \"Mmmmmmmm,\"
Veronica purred softly,\"you have such a nice tongue, dear, mmmmm, that\'s it, do mama\'s clitty for her,
oh yesssssss, you make mama feel so nice!!!\" As much as Erin needed a good fucking,
the chance to eat the delectable pussy of such a domineering and incredibly beautiful woman was too
good to pass up!!! \"Tell me, dear,\" Veronica asked softly, \"does this taste better than the
cunt of that little slut you live with, what\'s her name, Vanna I think it is!?!\" Momentarily stunned at the question,
Erin pulled her mouth away from Veronica\'s pussy and stammered, \"H-how do you know the name of my girl friend,
I\'ve never told you about her!?!\" \"Where do you think she comes when she needs a little pecker,\"
Veronica replied with an evil laugh, \"she\'s just like you, a closet cock hound,
now suck me!!!\" Erin\'s head was spinning as she pictured her lovely Vanna with
Veronica on top of her slamming her thick pecker into her tight little pussy,
and although it hurt to think of her cheating on her,\n

thinking about Vanna spreading wide and pleading for a Veronica\'s cock was nearly driving her insane with lust!!!
Erin was now so close to another orgasm and the need for that big pecker in her pussy was now almost overwhelming,
so with out warning she jumped back up on the bed landing on her hands and knees,
and after giving her ass a little shake, begged Veronica, \"Okay, bitch, give it to me now, you know you wanna fuck me, so do it!!!\"
Veronica was a little taken aback at Erin\'s demand, but the sight of the beautiful ass
and the bulging lips were like a magnet to the excited bull dyke, and so without another word, she took her place behind Erin\'s
bottom, and after lining up her big dick, buried the monster into the hot cunt with one mighty
plunge!!!\" \"Owwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeeeee,\" Erin screamed at the top of her lungs as the
brutally thick cudgel tore into her pussy, inducing a string of orgasms that threatened
to make the poor girl black out!!! \"T-take that\" Veronica grunted while pounding in
and out of the hot little snatch, \"you fucking bitches always come to Veronica when you need some dick,
well now you\'re gonna get it!!!\" .\n\n

Erin buried her face in the covers trying to muffle her
screams as the freight train like dildo moved brutally in and out of her,\n
but as badly as it hurt, the pleasure she derived from being taken and filled to the brim made up for any
discomfort she may have been feeling!!! Then, just as quickly as it had started,
it was over as Veronica slipped out of her and collapsed on the bed next to her,
while gently massaging Erin's brutally fucked cunt!!!131 With her pussy absolutely burning from the
vicious assault it had just endured,\n
Erin slowly began dressing while Veronica watched her from the bed with a quizzical look on her face!!! \"Say,\" Veroica said, \"
I have and idea, the next time you\'re in need, why not bring Vanna along, I\'d just adore fucking the two of you together!?!\"
After giving it a little thought, Erin looked over at Veronica and replied,\n
\"I don\'t know, I\'ll have to think about that, I\'m not sure,\" but while walking down the stairs on the way back to work,
she already knew the answer, as her pussy flinched as she pictured the three of them in the bed together, all for one, and one for all!!!\n\n

I would never change my first time.\n\n

The first time I had sex was when I was 15 and my boyfriend at the time was 16. The day before was Valentine\’s
Day and he had taken me out.\n
We had planned to have sex that day, but it just ended up not working in our favour.
The entire time we were out, we kept making out and rubbing crotches and grabbing ass.
It was something that was extremely built up.\n\n

The next day was a Friday, so after school I went over and we were already prepared with condoms and such.
We were on his bed making out heavily and we started to take off our clothes.
He asked me if I really wanted to do it, and that we could wait if I didn\'t feel ready.
He was very sweet about the whole ordeal.\n\n

When we got down to it, he rolled down the condom on his length, a little shakily,
but he got the job done nonetheless\n
He then proceeded to ask me again if I was ready and again,
I said yes. When he entered he did ever so slowly but of course like any virgin,
I felt the pain. I gasped a little and he got nervous and asked me if I was hurt.
He moved slowly and after a short few seconds I was luckily able to enjoy our sex.
It was slow and romantic as he moved himself in and out and his broad back
and smooth skin felt amazing under my hands.\n
I could just see in his face it was such an amazing feeling for
him to be in me and he moaned/sighed when he came.
Even though we didn\'t work out, I wouldn\'t ever change my first time.
I luckily had a pretty amazing first time.\n\n

I started swimming as I was small for my age and not very athletic.
I wasn\'t particularly fast,\n
but the swim coach spotted me doing laps and thought I had potential.\n\n

I accepted his offer to join the swim team and began practicing with them.\n\n

He worked on my technique and soon I was keeping up and beating the swimmers
who had the long limbs people think of swimmers having.\n\n

Coach was a disciplinarian and used his whistle and a paddleboard to get the attention of his athletes.
If he didn\'t like your stroke or thought you weren\'t putting in the right amount of effort you had better be ready to
duck the second you heard his whistle because a few seconds later he would launch a paddle board in your direction.\n\n

I knew the swim team and I would part ways as I was headed to university.\n\n

I had never done anything competitive so it was a bit of a revelation to discover I liked to compete.\n\n

Coach and I got along. I didn\'t know why at the time, but I seemed to be his favorite.
Maybe it was because I was coachable, eager to please, and put in a lot of effort to continually improve.\n\n

Or maybe it was something else.\n\n

I never talked to him after practice so it wasn\'t like we were buddies outside of the pool.\n\n

My parents have a small role in this story. They had met coach. They ran into him at a store or
party and talked to him for a while.\n\n

Weekend was approaching. My dad\'s view of his offspring was they were a source of labor.
He was a big believer in idle hands being the devil\'s workshop.
Finding things for us to do was also a bit of a power trip for him.\n\n

He wasn\'t above loaning us out to others who needed a hand.\n\n


I was finishing up the yard when he told me he had something for me to do.\n\n

\"Coach is moving into the neighborhood, two streets over.
He needs some strong backs to move his things. I told him you\'d help.\"\n\n

It was pointless to argue, and Coach had been good to me, so I answered, \"Yes sir,\" and asked what time he needed me.\n\n

He told me a time. Next morning I headed over to Coach\'s house.\n\n

There were a few other people at the house to help with the moving. I thought we\'d be done in a few hours with all the help he had.
Turned out Coach had a lot of crap to move. He also wanted us to set everything up.\n\n

I knew zero about Coach. I didn\'t know his marital status (divorced), where he went to college (OU),
if he had kids (yes, adults), what he did for a living (never did find out) or pretty much anything else.\n\n

He was in his late forties which made sense since his children were adults. He wore black framed glasses,
what we jokingly referred to as birth control devices because they were so plain and made the wearer look like a bit of a nerd.
He was clean shaven. He had short brown hair and brown eyes.\n\n

Nothing remarkable about him. He was of average height but taller than me as I was short. He looked fit.\n\n

He had nice things. By early evening we had all the boxes emptied, furniture assembled, closets, pantries,
and cabinets filled. His pool of helpers had changed throughout the day, but I stayed the entire time.\n\n

The day was winding down and I was about to leave with the other movers when he asked me to stick around for a few minutes.
He said he needed my help.\n\n

I shrugged my shoulders and said I would.\n\n

We really hadn\'t worked together but now we were hanging paintings and moving furniture around.
It had been a long day and I tweaked my shoulder blade.\n\n

He told me how much he appreciated my help. I told him it was my pleasure.
He also noticed I was favoring my shoulder.\n\n

I told him it was nothing.\n\n

He said, \"Bull. We need to work that kink out before it gets worse. Let me see.\"\n\n

It wasn\'t a request but an order. He was an authority figure. I faced away from him.
He massaged both shoulders for a minute. It did feel good.\n\n

\"Better?\" Coach asked.\n\n

I answered, \"I think so.\"\n\n

\"Just to be sure, you should let me give you a massage.\"\n\n

\"That\'s not necessary Coach. It\'s late.\"\n\n

\"Nonsense. It\'s not too late. A half hour and you\'ll be on your way.\"\n\n

He then asked, \"How about it?\"\n\n

I agreed to have him give me a massage.\n\n


\"Great. It\'s better if your muscles are all warmed up.\"\n\n

A minute later we were in the master bathroom.\n\n

He grabbed a couple of towels, threw me one, told me one was for drying off and the other for wrapping around my waist.\n\n

He closed the door behind him.\n\n

My body sensed what was happening was not normal.
I had a sudden urge to defecate. I was a bit embarrassed not just crapping,
but having a touch of diarrhea at his house.\n\n

He did ask if I was okay. I told him I was fine.\n\n

I then knew he had been listening for movement in the bathroom. Looking back,
I think he was wondering if I would bolt or for a reason to come in.\n\n

I stripped down, turned on the shower, let the water get hot and stepped in.
I felt nervous and my penis seemed to be trying to retract. In spite of the heat I had goosebumps.\n\n

I kept telling myself to relax, that what was going to happen wasn\'t weird, that I\'d get a massage and be on my way.
I reminded myself he was my coach and looking after me.\n\n

I got out of the shower, toweled myself dry.
The mirror was fogged over so I didn\'t look at my reflection.
Once I was dry, I wrapped the other towel around my waist.\n\n

I hung the damp towel to dry, took a deep breath, and exited the bathroom.\n\n

Coach was sitting on the edge of the bed. The covers were pulled down. He had spread a few towels on the fitted sheet.\n\n

I was a bit surprised to see he was only wearing underwear, but didn\'t say anything.\n\n

He must have read my mind because he held up a bottle and explained, \"Can get messy. I don\'t want to stain my clothes.
And it\'s more comfortable.\"\n\n

He tapped the bed indicating that\'s where he wanted me.\n\n

\"Lay down on your stomach.\"\n\n

I got on the bed and did as he asked.\n\n

He stood up and said, \"I\'ll work your back side first then do your front.\"\n\n

I had no idea his offer of a massage was going to be full body.\n\n

I also didn\'t say no. I just stayed quiet.\n\n

He squirted some oil onto the back of my legs. He leaned over and started working the backs of my lower legs and ankles, rotating my feet.\n\n

\"Nervous?\" he asked.\n\n

\"A little.\"\n\n


\"I could tell. You have goosebumps. Nothing to be nervous about. I don\'t bite.\n\n

It was a weird remark.\n\n

The edge of my towel went almost to my knees.\n\n

He asked if what he was doing felt good and I told him it did.\n\n

Lower back of my legs finished, he rather nonchalantly moved the towel up to where the bottom of my buttocks were exposed.
He applied oil to the back of my upper thighs, worked his way up and down them, then decided to join me on the bed.\n\n

He was kneeling between my legs, moved from my thighs and started working on my shoulders and back.
He was literally almost on top of me.\n\n

He commented I had muscles in my back and was lucky to have little body hair. He said something about how he had to remove his,
especially on his back.\n\n

He was breathing heavier and I sensed growing impatient because he tugged at the towel and opened it, exposing me to him.\n\n

He exhaled loudly and said, \"You\'ve got a cute tush. Girls like guys with good butts.\"\n\n

I didn\'t know how to respond other than to say, \"Thanks.\"\n\n

He worked the backs of my arms, stopped for a second, got off of the bed, then back on.\n\n

I knew what he was doing, but didn\'t say anything. I was in a state of disbelief that this was happening to me.\n\n

I told myself I wasn\'t gay. I wasn\'t attracted to men.\n\n

He gets back on the bed, and goes to work again on my shoulders. He\'s leaning into me and I can feel his hardness brush against my bottom.\n\n

\"Feels good doesn\'t it? You like massages don\'t you.\"\n\n

I closed my eyes which he interpreted as consent.\n\n

He paused I think to coat his cock with oil. I could feel my sphincter pulsating. My penis had gotten hard.\n\n

He stretched out on top of me. I felt his breath on my ear.\n
He used one hand to maneuver his cock up and down the length of my crack.\n
Satisfied he had located my anus, he rubbed and prodded it with his cock.\n\n

The realization of what he intended to do hit me, but I made no attempt to bolt and I said nothing to stop him.\n\n

His mouth against my ear, \"Relax.\"\n\n

He then ran his tongue against it before kissing the side of my neck.\n\n

\"You\'re big.\"\n\n

\"It will be okay.\"\n\n

He had me pinned to the bed so I wasn\'t going anywhere.\n\n

His breathing was very labored. He was I realized very excited.\n\n

He placed the head of his against me and pushed, pulled back, then pushed again,
and kept repeating until he was maybe a quarter inch inside of me.\n\n

He grabbed the bottle and poured oil where our bodies met.\n\n

Satisfied I was as lubricated as I was going to get and that he no longer needed his hand he took his arms,
put them under my armpits and placed his hands on the back of my neck.\n\n

I was going nowhere.\n\n

He then continued his assault on my bottom.\n
He pushed harder, warned me it would be a little uncomfortable, but only for a minute.\n

I told him it hurt, but again I didn\'t say stop.\n

He paused for a moment to let my bottom adjust then pushed a couple of inches into me. It briefly felt like something was tearing.\n
I felt a burning sensation as he sawed in and out of my bottom.\n\n

I wondered if he was all the way in me because it certainly felt like I was being fully penetrated.\n\n

I learned he wasn\'t even close. He began fucking me deeper and deeper until he was all the way in. His strokes were long.\n
He would plunge all the way in then pull almost all of the way out, leaving just the head inside of my bottom.\n\n

My body was slowly awakening to the pleasure.\n\n

I opened my legs wider. He took his hands off the back of my neck and wrapped them around my chest.\n\n

He licked my ear, nibbled on my earlobe. There was no stubble but his skin against mine felt rough.\n\n

He stroked in and out of me a dozen times before saying, \"Turn over.\"\n\n

He withdrew. I hurriedly rolled over, pulled my legs up to my chest.\n
He grabbed the bottle, placed it against my sphincter, squeezed it, then got on top of me.\n\n

Only this time I reached down and guided him into me.\n\n

All the way in me with one thrust of his hips, he looked at me, then pressed his mouth against mine.\n\n

My first French kiss and it was with a man old enough to be my dad.\n\n

I felt like a switch inside of me had been flipped because I went from being a passive participant to an active one.\n\n
I had my hands on his back and my feet hooked at the ankles as we fucked\n\n

All sorts of indelicate sounds escaped my bottom as he stroked the length of his manhood in and out of me.
What I didn\'t realize was his cock was hitting my prostate and ejaculate was flowing from my soft penis.\n\n

He sped up his thrusts and thrust hard. His mouth still glued to mine he grunted during our kiss as he came inside of me.\n\n

He stopped thrusting but didn\'t immediately withdraw.\n
It was a weird sensation I felt when he did because it was a relief to not have him in me,
but at the same I felt a void as I wanted him back in me.\n\n

The realization of what I had just done hit me.\n\n

I started to panic and said, \"I should go.\"\n\n


\"Not before you shower. We need to get that oil off of you.\"\n\n

What he said made sense.\n\n

\"Come on.\"\n\n

He took me by the hand and led me into the bathroom, turned on the shower.
We stepped inside. He grabbed a bar of soap and a washcloth and started washing me.\n\n

\"My hair,\" I said.\n\n

\"I\'ve got a blow dryer.\"\n\n

His hands felt good, especially when he soaped my genitals.\n\n

He knelt on the floor of the shower to wash my legs and took my erection into his mouth.\n
It didn\'t take him long to coax a climax out of me. Afterwards,
he finished cleaning the oil off my legs and feet.\n\n

When he stood up I felt his erection poking me in the stomach. I hadn\'t seen his fully engorged cock until then.
He was big. I wondered if he wanted me to suck it, but he had other ideas.\n\n

\"Turn around. Lean on the wall.\"\n\n

He squirted something on his cock, shampoo or conditioner.\n
My legs wide open. He bent his knees as he was taller than me, then placed his cock against my bottom and pushed.\n\n

It stung, but I didn\'t stop him. I just let him fuck me.\n
The water pouring off of our bodies, his hands on my hips,
he moved in and out of me before deciding he wanted to do something different.\n\n

He withdrew, turned off the shower, his voice hoarse with lust, told me to get on my hands and knees.\n\n

\"Don\'t worry about the water.\"\n\n

I\'m on my hands and knees on the carpeted mats. He gets behind me,
positions his cock against my bottom, and penetrates me. He places his hands on my hips as he strokes in and out of me.\n\n

I lower my head to the floor as my arms are tiring and because I imagine it\'s sexy. He has a lot of stamina. He pulls out,
pushes me to the floor, reaches for a bottle. He must have felt he needed more lubricant.\n\n

I\'m flat on the bathroom floor and he pushes himself into me.\n
Extending his arms his hands flat on the floor, he fucks me for another two or three minutes before coming in me for the second time.\n\n

\"That was good,\" he said as he pulls out of me.\n

He stands up. I get off of the floor. He tells me to hand him a towel.\n
I do. He dries me off, spends a lot of time drying between my buttocks.\n\n

Matter of fact, he tells me, \"You\'re going to be sore for a few days. Might even spot.
Don\'t freak out. It\'s normal.
Now go get dressed.\"\n\n

He dries off, joins me in the bedroom where I\'m putting on my clothes. He looks at the clock radio on his nightstand.\n\n

\"Too bad we don\'t have more time.\"\n\n

He doesn\'t get dressed.\n\n

I\'m very aware of his nudity. He seems not just comfortable being naked in front of me, but signaling he\'s in control.\n\n

\"Come here,\" he says.\n\n

He embraces me, tells me he had a good time, asks me if I enjoyed it.\n\n

I tell him I did.\n\n

Our age difference feels weird for some reason.\n\n

He lowers his head to kiss me, but I turn away.\n\n

He tells me, \"Don\'t be like that.\"\n\n

This time I don\'t just accept it when he presses his lips to mine, but hungrily kiss him. I like French kissing Coach.\n\n

We stand there and make out, me fully dressed and he completely naked.\n\n


I run my hands all over his back and his bottom.\n\n

We\'ve been kissing for a quarter of an hour. He\'s aroused again. My youth, my kisses, the newness.\n\n

I want to please him. I just drop to my knees, grab his cock, and place my mouth over the head.
I haven\'t a clue as to what to do. He lets me suck him for a few minutes.
I run my tongue up and down the length of his shaft, then back up and suck on the head.\n\n

He tells me I\'m doing great, but he won\'t be climaxing anytime soon. I get off of my knees, glance at his erection,
feel proud for making it so big, but frustrated because I wanted to make him climax, to swallow his seed.\n\n

Another French kiss. He tells me he can taste his cock on my breath.\n\n

We laugh.\n\n

I ask him when can I see him again.\n\n

He tells me soon and says he\'ll let me know.\n\n

I\'m like someone with their first crush.\n\n

\"Promise?\" I ask.\n\n

\"I promise,\" he answers before another long French kiss.\n\n

His cock is really hard. I\'m tempted to ask him to fuck me again, but my bottom hurts and it is getting late. I don\'t want my parents,
especially the old man, the one who loaned me out to Coach, asking me questions.\n\n

He then walks me to the door, but stays hidden behind it as I exit his house.\n\n

        <item>

I had been working in this place, a body rub parlor in an apartment off Columbus Avenue in Manhattan,
for a couple of months. For one-hundred dollars you could get a sensual massage on your backside,
then a frontal massage complete with what we called the \"happy ending\". It was quick money, and in
another week I\'d have enough to split for Hollywood and set myself up in an apartment.\n
Then, after a couple of well-placed blowjobs to the right people, hopefully I\'d get a part on a series,
or one of the dating reality shows. But I still had another week of pulling cocks before I had enough.\n\n

Anyway, like I said, I\'d been there a couple of months and I\'d serviced all types of
guys—businessmen, college students, professor types. And I\'d seen all sorts of bodies—tall, short,
fat, skinny, even a few well-built guys who were really hung.
But the one thing they all had in common was that I never gave a shit about any of them.
Just a dollar sign, I talk nice, pull their dicks and get them out the door. Except for this one guy.\n\n

He had made an appointment an hour earlier.\n
He sounded sort of nervous on the phone. He showed up on time and I opened the door to let him in.\n\n

\"Hello, Brad,\" I said. \"I\'m Rhonda\"\n\n

\"Hi,\" was about all he could muster. He was real pudgy, about 5\'\9\",
two-hundred pounds. He wore a dress shirt and slacks. At least he was clean.
You wouldn\'t believe how dirty some of the shitheads who come here are.
My guess is that he was some kind of scholarly nerd, maybe a grad student in philosophy.
I could tell he was really nervous.\n\n



\"Come on back,\" I said. I led him to the room with the massage table.
I asked if he wanted any extras. For an extra thirty, I\'ll go topless and you
can play with my tits as I stroke you.
But he said no, just the basic would be fine. Damn.
I took his one-hundred dollar fee and told him to undress, that I\'d be back in a minute.
I went into the parlor and put the money in my purse.\n\n

When I got back, he was naked, laying face down on the table.
I poured some baby oil in my hand and began to gently rub his shoulders. He flinched a little.\n\n

\"Is that cold?\" I asked.\n\n

\"No, it\'s alright,\" he said. Like I said, I never gave a shit about any of these guys,
and I didn\'t give a shit about him. But he was really uptight and sometimes uptight
guys have trouble getting it up when the time comes and it just makes my job harder.
So I knew I needed to loosen him up a little.\n\n

\"You seem nervous, Brad. Is this your first time in a place like this?\"\n\n

\"Yeah.\" I guessed that he must have been worried about his wife finding out.\n\n

\"Are you married?\" I asked.\n\n

\"No.\" So if not his wife, maybe his girlfriend.\n\n

\"Do you have a girlfriend?\"\n\n

\"No.\"\n\n

\"Wow,\" I said. \"No wife and no girlfriend.\" I kept rubbing his back ever so gently.
So if he wasn\'t worried about anyone finding out,
there had to be another reason he was so nervous.
I thought I had the answer. \"Brad, you\'re a shy guy, aren\'t you?\"\n\n

\"Yeah, I guess I am.\"\n\n

\"So. Are you a virgin?\" I knew some of the younger college age guys that came in were virgins,
I was pretty good at spotting them. He didn\'t say anything. \"It\'s okay, Brad, you can tell me.\"\n\n

\"Yeah.\" Bingo.\n\n

"Well, if you\'re a virgin, you\'ve come to the right place.\" I started working my way down his back.
\"Am I the first girl to ever see you naked?\"

\"Yeah.\"

\"Okay, then. Just relax, sweetie, I\'m going to take good care of you.\"
At this point I had worked my way down to the top of his ass.
But I skipped over it and started massaging his thighs\n\n

\"So, Brad, how old are you?\"

\"I\'m twenty-six,\" he said. I could hardly believe it, a twenty-six-year-old virgin.
I was twenty-two and my virginity was long gone.

\"Well, you\'ve got some catching up to do,\" I said. I started massaging his buns and he let out a little moan.
Obviously, he had never been touched there before. \"Feels good, doesn\'t it?\"

\"Yeah.\"

I dug my fingers in a little deeper and he let out another cute little moan.

\"Mmmm.\"

\"Okay,\" I said. \"Why don\'t you turn over and we\'ll do the other side.\" So he turned over and
I turned around to put some more baby oil on my hands.
When I turned back around, he was laying face up.
And I saw the origin of all his shyness—all four inches of it.
It was all I could do to suppress a smirk when I first saw it. I didn\'t want
to make him any more nervous than he already was. But in the months that I\'d been working here,
it was the tiniest little dicklet I had seen by far.

\"Okay, sweetheart, just relax.\" I started slowly rubbing the tip and he let out a moan. \"Feel good?\"\n\n

\"Mmmm, yeah,\" he said.\ "Mmmmm, mmmmm.\" As I stroked him with my right hand,
I gently swept my other hand over his chest. I gently pinched one nipple, then the other.\n\n

\"Mmmmm,mmmmm.\"
\n\n

\"Feels good, doesn\'t it babe.\"\n\n

\"Mmmmm, yeah, mmmmm.\" I had to admit it was the cutest little dick I\'d ever seen
and the way he moaned was kind of cute too.
I worked my left hand down to his soft tummy, obviously another place he\'d never been touched.\n\n

\"Mmmmm, mmmmm.\"\n\n

Then, while still stroking the head of his dick with my right, I started fondling his balls with my left. His moans got louder.\n\n

\"MMMMM,MMMMM.\"\n\n

\"Yeah, feels good, doesn\'t it.\" This tubby virgin was about to come and it
had barely been thirty seconds since I first touched his dick. But that was okay,
the sooner they come, the sooner they\'re out the door.\n\n

\"Come for me baby,\" I said.\n\n

\"UHHHHH, UHHHHH.\"\n\n

\"That\'s it, come for me.\"\n\n

\"UHH,UH,UH,UH.\" He shot his load all over his fat belly. I\'d never seen
anyone shoot so much cum in so little time from such a little tiny dick.
Fifty-nine seconds, a new record for the place.\n\n

I took a towel and cleaned him up. \"Did that feel good, Brad?\" I asked.\n\n

\"Yeah. Yeah.\"\n\n

\"Good. You can get dressed now. I\'ll be back in a minute,\" I told him.\n\n

I went to take a pee and when I came back, he was dressed. \"Did you have a good time?\" I asked.\n\n

\"Yeah, thank-you,\" he said. He took a twenty out of his pocket. \"Here, this is for you.\"\n\n

\"Thank-you, Brad.\" I have to say, it was the easiest tip I had earned.\n\n
I led him out into the hallway and towards the front door. I opened the door to let him out, but he turned around.\n\n

\"Rhonda?\" he asked.\n\n

"Yeah, Sweetie." He pulled another twenty out of his pocket.\n\n

\"I have twenty dollars left. Do you think...\"\n\n

\"Yeah, Sweetie. What?\" God, I just wanted to get this fat boy out the door so I\'d have
time for a cigarette before my next client.\n\n

\"Well...could I have a hug?\" he asked. I couldn\'t believe it.
Guys had offered me money for all sorts of extras--straight sex, blow-jobs.
I always had to tell them to forget it, we\'re strictly a hand-job parlor.
But no one had ever asked me for a hug.\n\n

\"Sure, Brad, why not?\" I took the twenty and put my arms around him. And all of a sudden,
all the contempt I felt for this poor guy fell away.
He came here for a hand-job; what he really wanted was a little affection.
He was so sweet. I held him for the longest time. I had to fight back the tears.\n\n

Finally, I let him go. \"I\'m glad you stopped by, Brad. Come back again some time.\"\n\n

\"Thank-you. I will,\" he said. I took the twenty and gave it back to him.\n\n

\"That was on the house,\" I said.\n\n

        <item>
I\’ve just got to tell you what happened in the back of the car last night.

\n\nMore than that, I\’ve got to tell you about the whole job. Every bloody bit of it.

\n\nBecause you are just not going to believe it.

\n\nSo I get this call at about three yesterday afternoon. It’s New Year’s Eve.
And it\’s a New Year\’s Eve like no other.
I’\ve got no jobs.
No one has any jobs.
Because nowhere is open.
Lockdown has shot all of us in this line of work.
Rides are rare.
But I get this call for a booking.
Now I\’m interested, but first up I ask if it\’s a joke.

\n\nThe caller assures me she is one hundred per cent genuine.
Her name is Alexis and I remember her.
She shares an apartment with two other girls.
She\’s booked several times before,
and I know she likes to have a laugh and a good time.
She often books last minute after a few drinks.

\n\nShe tells me she\’s fed up with this lockdown.

\n\n\“Don’t I know it,\” I reply.
\“It’s hitting my business real bad.”

\n\nShe says that her flatmates and her are missing bars and parties and clubs and people and fun.

\n\n\“I\’m with you on that,\” I say.
\“I\’m missing them and those fares.\”


\n\nThen she asks if she could hire the limo.
Tonight. She knows I\’ve got a limo in the fleet,
though I\’ve only ever booked her a cab before.

\n\nShe tells me that she and her flatmates want to have their own New Year\’s Eve party tonight. In the limo! They want to be picked up in the square, by the big Christmas tree, at ten. They want the bar in the back fully stocked and several bottles of bubbly on ice. If they can’t go to the party, the party’s going to go for them!

\n\n“I can do that,” I tell them. “No trouble.”

\n\nThen comes the big request. They want a human with a cock waiting for them in the limo. That’s God’s honest truth. They want a stud. And I’ve only got seven hours to find one! But they are willing to pay, and god do I need the money.

\n\nSo, I talk to my business partner. We make a few quick decisions. And what is that saying about decisions like that? Decide in haste, repent at leisure. So, we decided in haste. Real haste. But there ain’t going to be any repenting afterwards, I’m telling you. And seven hours later I’m driving to the square.

\n\nThey are there. Waving sparklers in front of that huge Christmas tree and just having the type of good time only girls can have when they hit the town.

\n\nThey see me as I pull up and straight away they start chattering and giggling. Excited. Eager. Enjoying that ‘before’ moment. They dance and skip up to the limo, arm in arm.

\n\nSo I nod to Angelo (he’s my stand-in stud, I’ll tell you about this later) to act the gentleman and get out and open the door for them and offer them a drink.

\n\nThe three of them pile in like it was the end of the party, not the start of it. I’m telling you, they were buzzing. The fizz starts to flow and they are cheering and laughing like they were at a festival and the lead act had just walked on.

\n\nThe kissing soon follows. With all that kissing and downing those glasses of champagne, the atmosphere is pretty fucking high, I can tell you.

\n\nI look carefully—in the mirror of course (God—I’m trying to be subtle) —and see they aren’t just kissing my stud. They are passionately kissing each other too. Like they are into girls as much as they are into guys. You get the picture?

\n\nSo I ask them where they want to go because all I know is that they’ve booked me for two hours. Now I’m thinking that they are heading to some illegal party or something like that. But Alexis just tells me to drive around the city, go wherever I like, just to end up back at their place when their time’s up.

\n\nI drive around the city centre, making up a journey when I hear that they’ve been giving each other dares and I need to head for that old bridge over the river.

\n\nWhen I drive over, I realise one of them is going to wave her tits out of the window. Fucking, bloody hell! So they open the window and lean out and Alexis only goes and pulls down her fucking bra and shows her boobs to the world! What about my fucking licence?

\n\nThe car behind flashes its headlights overtakes us and the driver gives me this thumbs-up sign. A flash for a flash. Jeez, I’m thinking, I just hope no one is making a note of my licence plate.

\n\nThey wind up the window, climb back in and the drink keeps flowing and I’m wondering if I put enough bottles in the fridge. And as they drink, the kissing sort of gets a bit deeper. Their tongues are touching—between the girls and my stud and between the girls themselves. Suddenly their hands are all over him, running up his chest, around his neck, on his cheek then down to his crotch.

\n\nNow, I’m trying to keep my eye on the road but it’s fucking hard not to keep staring in the mirror.  This is hot action. These girls are sexy. Real sexy. One has those boots that pull up over the knees. ‘Fuck me’ boots I think they call them. I’m thinking she’s going to get well and truly fucked.

\n\nNow I always keep a Polaroid camera in the car. It’s good for weddings and prom nights. Clients like to take snaps of themselves looking good. And Alexis sees it and starts taking shots of each other. Only they take shots of their arses, and I see that one of them rocks onto her back and opens her legs. No knickers. There’s a snap. There are laughs. Out of the camera comes a shot of a pussy. I’m not kidding you. A polaroid of a pussy!

\n\nAnyhow, things then move up a gear in the back.  The three of them unbutton Angelo’s shirt, unzip his fly and free his cock, which of course is as hard as a rod. It springs out, keen to see some action.

\n\nI have to swerve a bit as I’m drifting across lanes. Now you can’t blame me for looking more in the mirror than at the road. You’d do the same. Come on, admit it?

\n\nNow, you won’t fucking believe what the three of them do next. They gather round in a circle, all their hands on his cock, then start licking it together, like it’s a lollipop they’re sharing. Each enjoying little licks of his helmet before one of them turns to kiss him on the lips.

\n\nI slow up at a roundabout and glance back at the action behind me.


\n\nThey are now taking turns to give him a sexy blowjob.  Each one takes his cock right into their mouth and then bobs up and down.

\n\nI’m worrying Angelo’s not going to hold out. The thought of three women deep throating him one after another, coating his cock with their saliva and then passing him on to their friend is fucking hot. And I’m just praying that he doesn’t shoot his load too soon as I sense that each one wants him to fuck them before the journey’s over.

\n\nI have to turn right to avoid the one-way system. And when I’m through with the manoeuvre, I look back and there’s just this vision of three faces and one cock. This cock is the complete focus of their attention—they are licking, lubing it and loving every inch of it. Three greedy faces; one lucky cock.

\n\nI’m still trying to keep my eyes on the road, but I’m drawn more and more to the rear mirror. I’m forgetting to indicate. I’m turning late. I’m having to slam my brakes on. But I’ve just got to see what’s happening behind me.

\n\nI adjust my mirror and notice that now there’s more going on than just cock sucking. The girl in those boots starts to kiss the one in the little back dress. They are a cute duo in their matching ponytails.

\n\nNow they’re seriously into each other. Really seriously. And now I’m working out that there’s going to be more than just cock on the menu tonight. Not that they’ve moved completely on, every now and then they break from each other’s lips and give the cock a fucking good licking.

\n\nYou know, I reckon they’re used to this. It all seems to come very naturally to them. I’m guessing these girls have had orgies together before. Whatever’s happening between them, there’s always one keeping up the action on the cock—licking, pumping and keeping it hard, making sure it is always in play.

\n\nBy now I can’t even see my stud’s face anymore, he’s somewhere there, but all I can see is his cock, lips, legs, arms and arses.

\n\nI turn back to the road. Traffic lights. I slow up and put the handbrake on. Glancing back in the mirror I see that the cock sucking has paused and Alexis has got up and is straddling my guy reverse cowgirl style, and eases her pussy over his shaft and slowly slides down him.

\n\nThere’s always this look on a girl’s face when she is first entered. I always latch on to it when I watch porn. And Alexis sure has that look—it’s sort of excitement mixed with contentment.

\n\nYou know, I had this feeling that she was the one who was going to have the first fuck. She booked the trip after all, and she sure is the one calling the shots. She’s now riding up and down that cock. He’s not moving. He’s just sitting there letting her control the rhythm. God, I hope the feeling of tight pussy walls (pussies always feel a bit tighter in reverse cowgirl, don’t they?) isn’t going to push him over the edge?

\n\nThe car behind me hoots. The lights have turned green, but I hadn’t noticed. I pull away and when the traffic calms on a straight section of road I glance in the mirror again.

\n\nThings have changed. Alexis rather than the cock is now the centre of everyone’s attention. The girls are each sucking her nipples, and a male hand is stroking her clit.

\n\nI’ve got to tell you, she has such the most stunning pussy. Immaculately trimmed ginger triangle pointing to perfectly smooth lips below.

\n\nI look closer and see that beautiful shaved pussy of hers catch the light of some bright Christmas decorations we pass. She is wet. Gloriously, fucking wet.

\n\nI’m just glad that the limousine is automatic, as this is now becoming a one-handed drive. It was the sight of her pussy and gliding up and down his cock filling my mirror which did it for me. There’s no way I’m going to be indicating after that.

\n\nThe two girls are now taking it in turns to rub Alexis’ clit, and she starts to moan. Every now and then one of them pulls the cock out of her and gives it a fucking good licking.

\n\nAlexis picks up the speed and her moans get louder and she comes. But it’s one of those small climaxes that leaves you still hot and wanting more. She eases off the cock and the girl in the silver dress gives it a deep throating, before straddling it herself and easing it slowly inside her. After a few thrusts, Alexis, still in charge, pulls it out and shares a lick with the girl in black, before popping it back and smacking the girl’s arse. I catch glimpses of the silver girl’s pussy, pulled tight by Angelo’s cock, as she slides up and down. I see her lips rub the sides of his shaft, and I’m sensing that she’s gripping it hard, squeezing it tight.

\n\nAs the girl in silver rides Angelo, Alexis helps the other to get out of her dress. So, each one is going to have a fuck of their own.

\n\nWith her dress off, Alexis only fucking grabs some ice from the bucket on the bar and rubs in on her nipples, firming them up nicely.

\n\nMy stud, having fucked silver girl, now sits up to take the last girl from behind. This is the one time he is in control, and he thrusts away dictating the rhythm. Her nipples pucker and her cheeks redden. Now, her pussy is the last to be pleasured, and Jeez is she in need of this fuck. My gaze slips to a reflection of her pussy in the back window. Her juices are flowing. And I mean flowing. Thank God the upholstery is leather and I can wipe it clean in the morning.

\n\nLast is certainly not least is the girl in black’s moans and that sated look on her face is anything to go by. She is rocking back into that cock and eagerly taking it deep inside her cunt.

\n\nFor a moment I think my wonderful stud has come, but he pulls back, cock standing rigid and unmilked.

\n\nBy now I’ve reached their apartment and have parked up outside. I sense that I’ve got the timing about right as they have all been fucked and just need to enjoy Angelo’s come.

\n\nI’m not far off coming myself as I can focus on my fun now I’m no longer driving.

\n\nThey re-form that circle around his cock, and lick as a three, while Alexis pumps him with her hand, building up speed until I see his body tense and he lets out a moan.

\n\nHis spunk seeps out into three eager mouths. They share it between them, each getting a few sticky drips that coat their lips. And then they only fucking kiss each other. Spunk coated lips kissing spunk coated lips. And then I hear a contented purring coming from them as they milk that cock dry, sucking it as it ever so slowly softens.

\n\nI can hold out now more and I come too. I try to stifle my moans. I’m sure they don’t realise and I get away with it.

\n\nIn the back, they are celebrating and pop the cork on the last bottle of champagne and the four of them toast their ride.

\n\nAm I fucking jealous or what?

\n\nAfter they finish the bottle, I get out and open the door for them. You can see a look of surprise as I help them out. They assumed it would be the usual driver and asked why I’d taken his place. There was no fucking way he was going to do this fare.

\n\n“Heck no,” I say. “This job was always going to be mine.”

\n\nAlexis asks if I was watching from the driver’s seat.

\n\nNow I don’t know what to say. So I test the water: “Would you be cross if I’d taken a peek?”

\n\n“Fuck no,” she says. “It’s just made it even hotter knowing the driver was watching…” she winks and eyes me up and down, “especially since the driver happens to be a very sexy woman.”

\n\nHeat rushes to my cheeks and Alexis hands me the fare.

\n\n“By the way, where did you find him?” Alexis asks casting a glance to Angelo. “He’s hot,” she says. “Few guys could have lasted the ride and kept so hard for so long.”

\n\nI smile as she tells me they all liked the way he was up for the challenge. “And he has the most gorgeous cock!”

\n\n“I know that cock only too well,” I tell her.

\n\n“How so?” asks Alexis.

\n\n“Because he is my fucking husband,” I reply, raise one eyebrow and smile.

\n\nShe smiles back looking delighted. “Go him! Go you!”

\n\nSo, I know you aren’t going to believe what I have just told you. I don’t blame you. If I were sitting where you are I wouldn’t believe it either. But here are the fucking Polaroids to prove it.

And, by the way, Happy New Year.

\“Are you game for something a bit different?\” Meredith says to her lover when they are relaxing after some afternoon delight.

\n\n“Hmmm, what… yeah of course,” Jared mumbles half dozing.

\n\n“Next Sunday… be here at 7pm.”

\n\n“OK,” he replies a bit more awake.

\n\nThe week moves slowly both for Meredith and Jared. Too many meetings, too many obligations. But every time either of them has some time to relax, they daydream about what the weekend might bring.

\n\nMeredith plans carefully. She purchases a new black lacy teddy, a bright red lipstick, special candles and some silk rope.

\n\nJared daydreams of fucking her by the open window. He hasn’t any idea what is in store for him.

\n\nJared usually thinks of himself as an alpha male. He likes to be in control, to direct all the action. It has been one of the bones of contention with Meredith because she is a strong take-charge type of woman. Sometimes Jared feels that there is a power struggle between them, especially in the bedroom. He likes to be the one to end up on top in the end.

\n\nSunday afternoon, Meredith takes a hot bubble bath, carefully does her hair in a more severe style than she normally would. She ties it up in a French bun. She does her makeup more dramatically and caps it off with bright red fuck me lipstick. She pulls on her black leather gloves and black lace teddy, slips into her six-inch heels and she is ready.

\n\nPutting the old-fashioned wall mounted hook into the beam on the wall is harder than Meredith expected it would be but she manages without ruining her makeup. She sets the candles all around the room and turns out the lights, lights a Roja Dove amber candle for scent and grabs her long silk robe. She is ready.

\n\nWhen Jared arrives, Meredith senses he is already excited. He is wearing a suit as usual and she can see his hard cock outlined in his trousers. Meredith strips off his jacket and leaves him in his shirtsleeves and trousers, wingtip shoes still on. She makes sure to unbutton his shirt fully, revealing his delicious torso.

\n\n“Are you prepared to do everything I ask?” Meredith questions.

\n\nJared laughs nervously but then says, “yes.”

\n\n“Good,” Meredith says. “Your safe word is pineapple.”

\n\nJared laughs. “Why would I need a safe word?”

\n\n“Just in case…”

\n\n“OK. Pineapple works, I certainly wouldn’t use it normally during sex.”

\n\nMeredith blindfolds Jared with his own silk tie and leads him up to the lounge. She ties his hands together and takes him to the strong hook she embedded in the wood beam earlier.

\n\n“Back up three steps,” she commands and he does so until he is against the wall. Meredith raises his arms above his head and loops his hands over the hook so he is well restrained.

\n\nJared seems anxious but his dick is rock hard in his trousers and a small spot of pre-cum oozes into the fabric.

\n\nThe sight of the juices makes Meredith want to come almost immediately.

\n\nShe moans loudly signalling to Jared that she is aroused. She knows he can smell her, hear her but he cannot touch. She knows he wants to be inside her but is not in a position to take control.

\n\nShe starts by exploring his face, moving her gloved hand all over his cheeks, gripping his chin and then over his mouth and nose. He inhales deeply, and his knees start to buckle.

\n\n“Gods that smells divine,” Jared says when she leaves his mouth free to speak.

\n\nMeredith taps his face with her hand, a small sharp slap.

\n\n“Shhhh,” she says, “don’t speak until I tell you to.”

\n\nJared groans and nods.

\n\n“Good. Boy.” She punctuates each word with a short sharp slap to his cashmere covered dick. More precum oozes into the fabric. The smell and heat of it makes her start to drool.

\n\nMeredith unbuttons his shirt and removes it, scratching her sharp red nails down his chest and flicks his nipples twice.

\n\nJared jumps and yelps.

\n\n“That hurts,” he moans but she is not fooled by his complaint. She flicks his nipples again and watches as his cock pulses.

\n\n“It may hurt but you like it, boy,” she snickers.

\n\nHis chest and face turn a lovely shade of crimson. He looks as though he is about to protest but thinks better of it and remains silent. She strokes his hard big cock again saying, “That’s right boy. Quiet.”

\n\nShe brings one of the lit candles to his collar bone and slowly tips it until hot wax drips down to his nipple.

\n\n“Ahhhh,” he moans as the wax burns and then starts to cool.

\n\nShe dribbles the wax over his other nipple and watches it harden. Her own nipples are as hard as his by this point. She moves to tip the wax down the centre of his chest. “This is going to hurt coming off because of all your hair,” she muses. He stays quiet except for moans.


\n\nMeredith spends some time creating patterns on his chest with the wax, building up a thick layer of it and waiting for it to cool down. She removes his blindfold and takes out a buck knife. She brings the knife to his face and runs it over his cheek. “Don’t move or you will get cut,” Meredith says noticing him trying to control his trembling. Lowering the knife to the wax, she begins to remove it using a blunt edge. This tugs the hair on Jared’s chest and some is pulled out as Meredith picks at the wax. Jared yelps and whimpers and it delights her. It takes a long time and all the while his cock is pulsing in his trousers.

\n\n“I am going to come,” he moans.

\n\n“If you do, this evening is over and you don’t want that do you?”

\n\n“No Meredith.” His eyes are pleading. “No, I want more.”

\n\nShe squeezes his cock in his trousers. “Then. Don’t. Come.”

\n\nHe moans but remains still.

\n\nMeredith can tell he’s struggling and undoes his belt and removes it. Then she slowly unzips his trousers, rolling them down along with his pants until they are on the floor. Jared’s cock springs out hard, head sticking out from its protective sheath.

\n\n“Mmmm, that looks scrumptious,” she says as she watches the precum drip. Meredith gets down to eye level and takes one long lick from his balls to the tip, lapping up that nectar. “Mmmm it is delicious but that is enough for now.”

\n\nMeredith strokes his dick, watching him struggle not to come and runs her sharp nails around his shaft, pinching lightly at the sensitive skin. Jared howls with pleasure. She strokes him some more, the leather making the experience sublime. She leans in and takes his mouth, devouring him, leaving red lipstick over his lips and cheeks.

\n\nMeredith turns slowly and sways her ass about two inches from his tool. Jared watches, licking his lips. She backs slowly into him, bending from the waist, pushing onto his erection and rubbing him with her bum.

\n\nShe can sense him trying hard to hold back, she knows he wants her, he wants to release inside her sopping cunt, to feel her gripping him and to hear her screams of pleasure as he does.

\n\n“Good things come to boys who wait and nothing comes to boys who don’t.” Meredith says slyly and presses even harder into him before dancing away.

\n\n“Cock tease,” he says.

\n\nShe knows he doesn’t mind as long as he gets his satisfaction in the end. Meredith goes over to a silver candy bowl sitting on an end table and grabs a handful of something making sure Jared cannot see. She returns, runs a nail down the centre of his chest, scratching lightly all the way down until she is kneeling in front of him, examining his stiff bobbing dick in front of her face. She reaches out and grips the loose skin of his ball sack and quickly attaches a small clothespin. He yelps but doesn’t move. She attaches four more clips to his bollocks.

\n\nThe clips won’t hurt too much as long as no one touches them. She knows Jared fears the pain but he is obedient. He whimpers as Meredith flicks the clips and swallows his cock whole. She takes him all the way to the back of her throat and then down so that she is working on the root of his cock with her lips and can feel him pushing down her throat.

\n\nJared’s sounds of pleasure get louder as Meredith moves faster over his cock. She swirls her tongue around the root and then up to the head, licking the frenulum and sucking quicker and harder.

\n\nJared presses forward trying to get deeper in Meredith’s throat so he can come but his hands are still tied above his head and he cannot gain balance, she uses this to her advantage, keeping the power.

\n\nMeredith sucks on the head of his cock as she quickly pulls off the clothespins. The blood rushing into his balls causes Jared to scream but his dick becomes so hard it feels like it is made of marble except it is hot and pulsing. Meredith lets Jared’s cock fall from her mouth.

\n\n“That isn’t fair,” Jared complains.

\n\n“Yes it is. You agreed to do everything I asked,” Meredith replies.

\n\nJared bushes a deep scarlet. “Yes, Ma’am, I did.”

\n\nMeredith’s eyebrow raises at the ‘Ma’am’. She lowers Jared’s arms and leads him by his tied hands to the bedroom and her sumptuous four-poster bed. He climbs up into the centre and lies down on his back. Meredith unties one wrist and attaches it to the bedpost leaving the other free. Stripping off her teddy and kicking off her heels, she climbs up and positions herself on Jared’s chest. She plays with his nipples and enjoys watching his reactions.

\n\nMeredith slides up to Jared’s neck.

\n\n“Are you hungry?” she asks.

\n\n“Yes.”

\n\n“Good,” Meredith says and crawls up until she is sitting on his face. Jared starts by licking her pussy and quickly finds her clitoris. His tongue circles around the wet erect bud and then he begins to suck it. Meredith moans and pushes her cunt further onto his face. He is only able to breathe when she allows him to and she finds it difficult to take her attention away from his mouth, lips and tongue to allow him to inhale. Meredith rides Jared’s face until she reaches a shattering orgasm. She squirts as she does and covers his face and hair with her ejaculate. As he licks up as much as he can, she has another orgasm.

\n\nAs her breathing returns to normal, Meredith slowly slides off Jared’s face and lies down next to him for a rest.

\n\n“Let’s have a shower,” Meredith says and unties Jared’s hands. “But you still have to do as I say.”

\n\n“Yes Ma’am,” he agrees and they walk into the bathroom.

\n\nThe double shower cubicle is extra large. On the floor, a deep pile bathmat and on the rack two big fluffy red bath sheets. The water heats up quickly and Meredith steps under the stream. Jared steps in behind her and unpins her hair. She moans as he runs his fingers through it and over her scalp. He takes some shampoo and lathers it into her hair. His fingers linger on her scalp, massaging deeply. He washes out the shampoo and repeats with deep conditioner. Meredith’s moans become louder as he works the tension from her scalp and slowly moves down to her face. He massages her cheekbones, temples, forehead, around her lips and chin. She can feel the tension ebb away.

\n\nJared rinses the conditioner from Meredith’s hair, takes the shower crème and starts massaging it into her body. He spends a long time on her neck and shoulders and then works all the way down her spine. He works on her arms, legs and back up her body to massage her breasts.

\n\n“Bad boy,” Meredith chides as he pinches one of her nipples.

\n\nJared turns her and leans in, starting to suckle on her nipple. It deepens in tone until the tip seems almost fire engine red. He chews on the tight flesh, sliding one finger down between her nether lips to roll over her slippery button until she is close to screaming again.

\n\nJared slides down Meredith’s body until his face is in front of her beautiful cunt. He parts her lips with his tongue and presses his face into her wetness, sucking, licking and twirling her clitoris until she is fucking his face, trying to get more purchase to reach another peak. Jared slows down, trying to draw her orgasm out. Meredith grabs his head and pulls him to her. Rubbing herself against his face until she comes again.

\n\nJared’s cock is rock hard. He slides up Meredith’s body and pushes her against the shower wall.

\n\n“I want to fuck you in here,” he growls into her ear.

\n\n“No, Jared. I will turn into a prune!” Meredith replies. She turns off the shower and leads him out. They wrap themselves in the fluffy bath sheets, each helping the other to dry off. Meredith leads her lover back into the bedroom.

\n\nThey get into bed and start kissing, slowly, exploring each other’s mouths fully. Their tongues battle and then retreat, exploring the roof and sides of the mouth.

\n\n“Did you know that the inside of your cheek is the same flesh as the inside of your vagina?” Jared mumbled between kisses.

\n\n“Is that so?” Meredith replies and continues exploring his mouth.

\n\nJared moves from Meredith’s mouth to her neck, nibbling and sucking, causing her to squirm.

\n\n“Tasty,” he mumbles and then moves down to her tits again.

\n\nMeredith cannot be still. She grabs his head and holds him as he suckles on her left breast.

\n\n“More, more,” she moans and he sucks as much of her tit into his mouth as he can. His tongue runs around the nipple as he sucks. Once he has reduced Meredith to jelly, he moves to her waist and flips her onto her stomach.

\n\nJared slides up Meredith’s body, using his knee to split her legs apart.

\n\n“On your knees pretty one,” he says. Meredith gets onto all fours. Jared slowly guides his rigid dick into her soaked pussy. Deep inside, he begins to stroke slowly and then a bit more quickly. Meredith fucks him back until he is pistoning into her and she can do nothing other than receive his thrusts. He reaches around and taps her clitoris in rhythm to his strokes and is soon rewarded with orgasmic convulsions around his cock and she knows she is pulling him into his own little death.

\n\nJared stays inside her and after a few minutes, she feels him harden again.

\n\n“This hasn’t happened in years,” Jared says.

\n\n“Kinky pleasure must agree with you,” Meredith chuckles.

\n\nJared starts stroking again, slowly, until his dick is solid. He slides out of Meredith’s pussy. “I feel like fucking your ass,” he says.

\n\n“Grab the lube,” Meredith replies.

\n\nJared lubes up his fingers and taps lightly on her anus until she relaxes slightly then slides two into Meredith slowly. She moans and pushes back against him. He finger-fucks her bottom, it’s too much and Meredith cries out, “please, I am ready.”

\n\nJared chuckles and slicks lube over his cock. He presses his dick against her bumhole and waits.

\n\n“A gentleman always knocks at the door before entering,” Jared says, pausing.

\n\nMeredith pushes back a little, accepting his request and he pushes the tip into her tight hole. When he gets past the sphincters, he stops and lets her get used to the fullness inside her. She moans in pleasure and wiggles her arse. Jared starts sliding in and out of her booty picking up his pace until he is banging into her. Meredith squeals with pleasure the harder he fucks her. Suddenly, Jared howls as he floods her asshole with his come. He collapses on top of her.

\n\nAfter Jared’s breathing returns to normal, he pulls out carefully, heads to the loo and grabs a warm wet hand towel to clean them both up. Meredith enjoys being the pampered one for a change. Once cleaned up, Meredith heads to the loo. She comes back by way of the kitchen with spring water and some strawberries. She feeds Jared the first strawberry and then licks the juice off his lips.

\n\n“Delicious,” Meredith exclaims.

\n\n“Yes, yes you are,” Jared replies.

\n\nSnack finished, it is time to try to settle to sleep. Meredith settles into Jared’s arms under the duvet, and as she switches off the bedside lamp.

\n\n“Next time, I am the boss.” Jared whispers as he snuggles into her neck.

\n\n“We’ll see…”

\n\n“Count on it,” Jared says as they are drifting off to sleep.

\n\n“When was the last time you were well and truly fucked?”

\n\nJenny’s cheeks burned in response. He was really asking this… in a coffee shop of all places? She glanced around, curious if anyone could hear the filth coming from his mouth. Such a pretty mouth. Steve had a pouty bottom lip she wanted to suck and bite. A mouth that no doubt knew how to please a woman.

\n\n“Answer me.” The corners of his eyes creased as he narrowed them.

\n\nShe swallowed. “Months.”

\n\nAn edge of his succulent lips pulled up in a conspiratorial smirk. She squeezed her thighs together. She knew she was done for. She had a thing for older men. Always had. Men her age were boring, self-serving. Fooled themselves into believing all their online Dom bullshit and cared only for their pleasure.

\n\nWork had put her in a dry spell, as dry as the books they preserved and restored in the library. Until he’d showed up to lead her department. Elegant, refined, and dripping with panache. She couldn’t stop thinking of being taken over the scanner. Or touched as delicately as he fingered the antique pages.

\n\nOpening his wallet, he tossed a fifty onto the table, stood, and grabbed his coat. “Come on.”

\n\n“Where are we going?” The question lingered in the air for a few moments without a reply, but she followed him still. Ever the curious and obedient little thing.

\n\nHe took her hand in his once outside. “My place.”

\n\nStreet lights reflected in still puddles, making the night shimmer all around. His flat wasn’t far, a few blocks from the café, but her pulse raced with the unknown as the elevator opened and he pulled her inside. She barely had a moment to think before his mouth crushed against hers. Rough, commanding. It both calmed and sent her heart beating faster.

\n\nHis tongue slipped along hers, eliciting a whimper. She wondered if she could come from his mouth alone. His skilled kisses tested that theory as they explored. The elevator opened to a dark hallway. He walked her out, pushing her against a wall before hoisting her up. Legs wrapped around his waist. Her cunt was aching, and they hadn’t even made it inside his place yet. She couldn’t keep her mouth off him. Finally, he opened his flat. But no respite welcomed her here as he pressed her against the back of the door, pinning her wrists.

\n\nHe didn’t speak, only smiled wickedly before taking her lips once more. Her skin tingled. She couldn’t fathom what he had in store, but she yearned for every moment of it. He sucked at her neck and let her arms go. Taking the chance, she pushed his coat off his shoulder and let it fall to the floor. He then did the same.

\n\nHe unbuckled her belt, and the tantalizing sound of a zipper falling filled the small space. He explored the dip of her stomach, just below her belly button, and down to the very edge of her aching clit. She opened her body to him. He could have it. Every inch. She’d needed this for so long. Her cheeks flushed as his fingers found her slick slit. A dark snicker escaped him. Half of her loved the embarrassment, revelled in her need being so exposed. The air around them seemed to crackle.

\n\n“I know you want it, but you can’t have it. Not yet.” His voice was deep, breathy. He fisted the back of her head, his other hand finding her opening and invading without a moment’s pause.

\n\nShe clung to his shirt, her mouth falling open as he fingerfucked her before pinning her hands over her head and holding them there. His touch grazed down her body. Caressing. Appraising. Claiming. Downward it went, dipping between her folds once more. He swallowed her moans like sustenance.

\n\nHe slipped his fingers in her mouth, teasing her tongue before molesting her. “This is what a needy little slut tastes like.” Even in the dim lighting, his eyes seemed to gleam. “Tastes good, doesn’t it?”

\n\nShe nodded softly. This is what she’d needed—to be manhandled, taken, used, and made to moan like the whore she was deep down. He devoured her sounds like he owned them and was fuelled by them. And he did. He owned every inch of her tonight. His hands traversed her body. His tongue made love to her mouth. The girth of his fingers filled her, readying her for what she prayed was to come.

\n\nHe gripped her throat. “Good things come to those who wait. Don’t you want to be good for me?”

\n\n“Uh huh.” She nodded.

\n\nShe longed to be everything for him. Virgin and whore, and everything in-between. He only needed to say the words. He trained his gaze at her and continued his assault on her cunt. Those moments when he didn’t speak, when he merely stared into her, made her even wetter. It was so intimidating, almost predatory. A beast. And she needed to be consumed.

\n\n“Please,” she begged but had no idea for what. To stop? For more? Both? She wasn’t certain she even knew herself anymore.

\n\nHe drew his tongue over her open mouth, marking his territory in silence. Such intense needs and wants surged through her. Never in her life had she desired someone to spit into her mouth, but fuck did she want it right now. Then he stopped. The stillness brought her mind squarely to the pulse of her clit. Like a little heartbeat yearning for him.

\n\nTurning the corner, Steve walked her backwards into another room and pinned her against a wall again. His tongue stroked expertly at the warm cavern of her mouth. Suddenly, his hand was around her throat once more. Her jaw fell open. He flicked on the light, exposing her wanton face to him.

\n\n“You need this. You know you do.” His lips devoured hers. “That little cunt of yours deserves to be fucked right.”

\n\nHe pushed her, face forward, onto a settee and knelt down behind, caressing her ass. She watched over her shoulder as he worked her jeans down, followed by her knickers.

\n\n“Sluts didn’t need clothes,” she recalled him saying one night after work when the rest of the department had gone home, leaving them there to stew in the tension. He was proving it now.

\n\nThe air licked at her slit but was quickly tempered by the warmth of his kisses along her cheeks. The sight of him was something to behold. His eyes were closed. He gripped her thighs, moving like a man lost in reverent worship as he caressed his face over her plumpness. Reaching up, he shoved her shoulders down into the settee’s back, arching her as his tongue slid between her folds. This was a man who loved to eat a woman. Her eyes fluttered, but she managed to once again lock her vision on him. His large hands held her open and bared all her honeyed goodness for him to sup on.

\n\nHe spit on her pussy before taking a long, slow lick and repeating the depravity once again. This is what she was learning to enjoy about him. Such a cultivated man but with debauched tastes lingering below his refined surface. Someone who could fulfil all her needs and even awaken new ones.

\n\nThe tip of his nose danced across her asshole as he ate her. She whimpered. Gripping the back of the sofa, she imagined what it would be like for him to fuck her there. No one ever had. She’d had no desire to before. But Steve could have anything he wanted. Every part of her. Every hole.

\n\nHe continued with his feast until her moans grew louder, pushing the air from the small room. She gripped his hand as her climax swept through her stomach and melted from her cunt. But his assault never ceased. He knelt beside her on the sofa, his fingers pressing into her soaked entrance with ease and relentlessly fucking her.


\n\n“You don’t even want to think anymore, do you?” His breath was hot against her face.

\n\nShe shook her head, stars bursting behind her eyelids. “No, Sir.”

\n\nHe was right. This is what she’d wanted, to be so dumbfounded with bliss that she couldn’t even form words, thoughts… All decisions would be his alone. She was just a toy. Something to be enjoyed, played with.

\n\nHe gripped her throat, not letting up even as her cunt squeezed his fingers in release. He wanted everything. She wanted him to have it. Soon, he tapered off the intensity, standing to undo his belt and zipper. He wasted no time slipping into her like putting on a most perfect glove.

\n\nTheir mouths met. Buttons popped, scattering across the floor, as he ripped her blouse open before engulfing her breasts with his large hands. How could she ever go back to anyone else after him? After feeling how desired she could truly be?

\n\nShe bent back over, feeling his thickness stretching her open. Her long hair teased and brushed her hard nipples. His fingertips dug into the flesh of her hips.

\n\n“You feel so fucking good.”

\n\nThat praise flowed through her, lighting her up. For a moment, she took control, pushing her ass back on his cock, so hungry for more.

\n\n“There you go, baby. Get what you need.” He lauded her with his touch, ghosting over her nipples and caressing her throat. Then he used her wrecked blouse to pull her up and around, sitting her back on the settee. “Keep them behind you,” he spoke of her arms. He stood, his huge cock jutting out like a creamy treat.

\n\n“Yes, Sir.” Oh, god, yes. Use me. Wreck me. Make me no good for anyone else.

\n\nCupping the back of her head, he lowered her down. She opened her mouth happily, almost giddy to taste herself on him. A moan vibrated around his thickness as she got her first mouthful. He pumped his hips. His sounds were so sexy. The pair of them soon fell into a rhythm until he fisted her hair, pulling her back. She gazed up into his eyes. Drool dripped from the corner of her mouth.

\n\nHe traced the head of his dick around her wet lips. “You like making a mess, don’t you?” He smiled, his eyes once again showing his age in a way that made her melt. “I knew you would.” He gripped the sides of her head, fucking into her willing mouth before kneeling once again to thank her with a kiss. They slid their tongues against one another, making love in their own way.

\n\n“I’m nowhere near finished with you, little one.” He fondled her chest, grazing the palms of his experienced hands over the beads of her nipples as he held her by the neck.

\n\n“I don’t want you to ever be.”

\n\nHe chuckled, rich and deep, gripping her throat and kissing her with every ounce of passion that was missing from her life. A nipple was caught between his fingers. Her bottom lip trapped between his teeth. He applied pressure to both, eliciting a needy gasp. She was a fly caught in his web, and she never wanted to be free. She wanted to be eaten, devoured, used.

\n\nHe rose to his feet again, towering over her as he slipped back into her. Spit dripped down his dick as he used her mouth. His girth filled her throat, making her feel so used. She felt so beautiful and respected with the way he would stop to bend and kiss her, as if to thank her before fucking her face once more. The gagging sounds only turned him on more and her as well.

\n\n“You’re doing so well.” He stroked her cheek.

\n\nHurriedly, he finished fully undressing her. She stared in anticipation and awe as he hooked his arms under her thighs and yanked her body down, positioning her for further use. Her thighs were spread wide. She wrapped her hand around his hot, slick cock. His fingers once again found home inside her. She had never felt passion this intense, this consuming. He couldn’t get enough of her. His ferocity was almost frightening—almost. But excitement won over.

\n\nHe sucked the honey from his fingers, then shoved them into her mouth in a demonstration of dominance. How could something so roughly filthy make her feel so desired and wanted? She was at a loss but never wanted it to end. His free hand pinned her head back, forcing her gaze on his.

\n\n“I want you to come for me.”

\n\nMouths met once more as he went back to work, stroking the inside of her cunt like a maestro. She did her best to pleasure him, but wave after wave rushed over her body, stilling her hand.

\n\nA sweet, warm ache formed in her pelvis. It was reminiscent of her favourite thing: morning masturbation when her bladder was nice and full. The pressure would press against her G-spot and heighten her arousal as she fingerfucked herself into oblivion. But that had hardly prepared her for what her body did now. Wetness squirted forward, uncontrollable as she came and soaked his palm.

\n\n“Good girl. Let it go,” he cooed before kneeling and sucking the lust from its source. He ravenously tongued her folds, keeping her forever suspended in orgasm.

\n\nDisbelief washed through her as he rose again and slipped his fingers into stroke her spot. He was forceful, fucking her hard. Her head spun. She squirted once more as her body shook. It was as if he’d possessed her, controlling her from within and making her his. Every inch of skin felt sensitive. Tongues explored each other’s mouths as he pulled her into his arm, switching them around so he rested on the settee.

\n\nShe straddled his lap and ground her pussy along his length, writhing like a luring nymph. “Please,” she begged. His fingers had been marvellous, but her body craved to be filled with something thicker. She lifted just enough for him to push down his jeans. “Please fuck me.”

\n\n“Show me.” He stared up at her, almost challenging as she sunk down and enveloped his dick. “Show me what a little whore you are.”

\n\nShe gripped the back of the small couch and rolled her hips a few times before bouncing on him. He filled her perfectly. Just enough to where the pain of the stretch brushed against pleasure. He was bare, raw, and she could feel every vein. His fingertips pressed into the flesh of her hips then ass, urging her on. Moans filled the space between them.

\n\n“There you go, fuck me, baby.”

\n\nThe sexiness of gravel in his voice made her moan. Breaths danced across his lips. His hold spread her and air licked at her asshole. She had to, needed to, make this last. Bracing her weight against his hard chest, she rode him hard. The frenetic energy of the night boiled in her system. He pinched her nipples, making her cry out. His groans joined hers, heightening. Another climax neared, and she warred with whether she wanted it yet or not. She longed for the tryst to last. To be used and spent all night.

\n\nHe gripped her throat, then pinned her arms behind her back. Never once did she stop fucking him. Her moans grew louder as she ground her clit against his pelvis. Her body jerked. She felt unsteady and braced herself against his chest before dipping her head to kiss him, moving slow atop him to make the climax last.

\n\nBut she needed more. Nothing would ever be enough. She arched her back, taking his slick cock him deeper.

\n\n“Yeah, you’re still hungry, aren’t you?” He smirked. “You want more cock?”

\n\nShe nodded before bouncing once again. He rolled his hips, lifting to meet her movements with his own soft thrusts. His breath was hot against her breasts. His pants grew louder. His stamina, restraint, and subtle gravitas only made her want him more. She took the lead and rode him faster.

\n\n“Come on. Come on,” he coaxed her. “You’re so beautiful like this, cock-drunk and spent.”

\n\nShe lost count of the number of times she came, but finally her pulsating cunt sent him over the edge. Warm cum filled her, and she stilled herself, letting him empty inside her. She held him close, and he sucked her nipple, tracing it hungrily with his tongue.

\n\n“That was fucking amazing,” she whispered with a soft laugh, raising enough for his cock to slip back out. Cum oozed from her, and she loved the feeling of it.

\n\nHe wrapped her in his arms, cradling her against him as he drew his fingertips over her back and over the peaks of her shoulder blades with a gentleness that threatened to break her more than his rough fucking ever could. Goosebumps rose in his wake. For as fiercely as he’d had her, the afterglow was delicate and soft. She’d needed a man who knew how to do both.

\n\n“Stay the night,” he stated after a little bit of silence.

\n\nFresh heat rose to her cheeks. To be treated so tenderly meant the world to her. She lifted her head to look at him. “Yeah?”
nA smile pulled at his lips, resting in his eyes. “Yeah.” He brushed the back of his hand against her cheek. “I’ll order us some food, and you need a new shirt, anyway.” He motioned to hers discarded and wrecked on the floor.

\n\nShe chuckled. “I’d like that.” Their lips met once more. “Perhaps a bath first?”

\n\n“Anything you want.” He brushed the hair off her shoulder, causing her a shiver a bit. “It’s yours.”

\n\n“I hope that includes seconds.” She raked her teeth over her bottom lip. “I’m a greedy girl tonight.”

\n\nHis smile lit up his eyes. “Good. That’s my favourite kind.”

I don’t know if everyone gets horny when they’re driving, but I certainly do. Something about quiet roads at night in the dark and the gentle thrum of the engine… The long, monotonous journey needs some entertainment to break it up, so my mind wanders to a sex fantasy video I’ve had ever since I first passed my driving test: the woman in the black trenchcoat.

\n\nIt’s hot because she’s a stranger, and not just any stranger either—one who’s been waiting for a guy exactly like me. Hoping I’ll drive down this lonely, twisting dark road. A turn off leads to the woods, and that’s where she lies in wait. As the car pulls in to the clearing, headlights cutting through the darkness of the night, this enigmatic stranger steps out to catch my attention. I can almost feel the throb of excitement as she realises the car contains exactly the kind of person she’s been waiting for: a guy ready to give her what she wants.

\n\nShe doesn’t wave the car down: she doesn’t need to. As soon as I see her illuminated in the headlights I slow down, then stop and cut the engine. She’s a vision: like a mirage there to greet me on the night drive. Long black trenchcoat, black heels, hair tucked neatly under a black trilby that casts shadows over her eyes, teasing the mystery of who this stranger might be.

\n\nThough I never know who she is exactly, there is never a question about what she’s there for. In the glow of the car lights, she starts to slowly tease open her trenchcoat, dancing—almost shimmering—as she sways and grinds her hips in time to a tune that only she can hear. My heart beats in my throat, blood warming me from lips to crotch. For the first few seconds, I am paralysed—captured in her gaze and unsure how to proceed. At first, I don’t approach her. I just watch as she ripples her body, flashing taut thighs from beneath the coat and a devilish, horny smile from beneath the brim of her hat. She’s wearing earrings that brush against her slim neck accentuating her collarbone and cleavage. I can see flashes of red straps at the collar of her coat, and like a horny teenager, my mind wanders inevitably to what she might be wearing underneath.

\n\nMy cock twitches in anticipation. And I know my eagerness won’t be misplaced: she’s not just inviting me to join her, she’s almost commanding. That outfit and those moves and that killer, wicked smile demand that I get out of the car and give her what she wants.

\n\nWho am I to argue? I want to devour her. I get out of the car and step into the headlights beside her. God, women always look so stunning in this light: it picks out the warm curves of their skin so beautifully and casts shadows that make me want to explore further. Bury my face in the darkness and worship the parts of her body the light touches. I want to submerge myself under that teasing black trenchcoat and drink in every detail of the body it’s almost revealing.

\n\nShe doesn’t touch me—not yet—but walks slowly back to the car. I’m thrumming now with a sudden urgency. I open the door as if to invite her inside, aching deeply for the first sensation of the head of my cock sliding into her cunt, but she’s got far more planned before that. So much more. I am hyper-aware of the thick weight of my big dick in my pants, and it hurts for straining against the fabric. But—thank God—I don’t have to wait long before relief because as soon as we’re back at the car she drops to her knees and unzips me.

\n\nChrist, is there any sight more beautiful than someone taking their first taste of your dick? I don’t think so. The sight of her dipping her head to place wet lips on the head of my cock gives me that gut-punch of thudding lust, and I urge her onward to more. Long, teasing licks that cover me in wet spit, moist kisses that encompass the whole of the head, and wide-mouthed sucks that give me that throbbing, complete sensation as her whole mouth engulfs me.

\n\nThe night air is chilly, but not cold. Just cool enough that I tingle from the waist down—the light nighttime breeze brushes against my skin, heightening the feeling of her warm, wet lips as they work at the head of my dick. She’s good at this—so good. Both playful and powerful: alternating fluttering licks against the underside of the head with huge mouthfuls of as much of me as she can take, soaking the full length of my shaft and swallowing as much as she can. I can see her tongue flicking over the taut, straining head of my erection and every now and then—the best part, oh the very best part—she gives me these mischievous flashes of her eyes from under the brim of the hat. She’s taking the fat length of me right inside her mouth, and still I haven’t fully seen her face—this mystery woman. This dick-jerking fantasy.

\n\nThe woods around us echo with night noises, and my blood thuds harder through my veins when I remember that there could be anyone out there watching us. Maybe this is why she comes to the woods? To enlist men like me to help her put on a show for others watching in the darkness. Maybe this is just her filthy little secret—how she gets her kicks, living out here in the middle of nowhere. Maybe one day she spotted that trenchcoat in a second-hand shop and had this exact fantasy, dreaming of letting her inner slut out to play. I don’t mind why she does it, because in my driving daydream all I care about is that I’m the one she has chosen. And soon she’ll choose to show me exactly what’s under that coat.

\n\nI’m getting hot now, so I take off my own jacket, and she takes this moment to move inside the car. She slides across the seat and oh God the sight of her—the flash of her thighs and bottom as she slips in. Warm, bare skin on leather seats. I can’t wait to get my hands on her. As I climb in after her, she unbuttons her jacket and I finally get to see what’s under that inviting coat: a red bodysuit. Bright red. Danger red. Come-get-me red. Fuck-me-in-the-back-seat-then-cum-on-my-ass red. Straps holding her tits tight to her body and obviously—obviously – no time-wasting knickers underneath, just a few fasteners that I can pop open to expose her slick, wet cunt.

\n\nIn that moment I realise I don’t want to fuck her just yet. First I want to make her gasp and squeal with pleasure. She’s this wet already just from sucking my cock—how much more can I do for her with my fingers and hands? I want to give her the kind of pleasure she’s already laid on my dick, so let’s see what I can do to make her squirm, shall we?

\n\nFirst I slip two fingers inside—wet and firm, curled in that come-here gesture that presses tightly against the front wall of her cunt. Opening her just enough that she has something to clench and grind against, though not so much that I won’t still get to enjoy her full-throated gasp when I finally fill her with cock. In and out, slowly at first then rapidly speeding up as her moans make it clear she needs it harder and faster. Yeah, that’s it—that’s the right spot. In my fantasy fuck with this mystery woman, we communicate without words, and I’m practically reading her mind. I can hear in the crack of her voice and feel in the way she squirms at my fingertips exactly how much pressure to use, and what speed. Yeah, that’s exactly it. Her pants and squeals get louder until I’m fully fucking her now with my fingers. Intense and firm and quick, so I can hear how slick her pussy is—wet and sloppy – echoing rhythmic schlick schlick schlick sounds as I shove them in and out. Back and forth. Cupping her mons in my palm and rubbing against her clit on each in-stroke, pushing up into her with force like she wants me to.

\n\nShe makes such fabulous noises—little shrieks and squeals of pleasure, all conjured by my own hands. My cock is throbbing with the ache of wanting to fuck her. But not yet—not yet. First, a crescendo of gasps and squeals accompanied by that delicious tight crush of her pussy pulsing around my fingers in the first throes of orgasm. I cannot get enough of that sensation—like she’s holding tight onto my fingers and doesn’t want to let go till she’s wrung the last drops of pleasure from what I’m doing to her. I press one of her hands against her clit too, so she can rub herself throughout those glorious rolling waves, eking every shiver of pleasure from her twitching cunt.

\n\nMy fingers are drenched with her cum. That feeling of cunt-convulsing slickness is so powerful I know I won’t be able to wait much longer before sliding myself inside her eager cunt. I lift my fingers to her mouth so she can smell and taste herself—that hot, musky, glorious flavour that is so unique to everyone. Even though it’s fantasy, as I let myself delve deeper in my dream of the mystery woman, sometimes I imagine I can smell and taste her, even here sitting alone in my car. The evocative, powerful scent of post-orgasm pussy, dripping from my fingers as I push them through her wet lips. She sucks at them the way she greedily sucked on my dick, and even grabs my hand as I try to pull it away, begging me for one more taste of herself.

\n\nIt’s time now, I can’t wait any longer—that body, fuck! The way she looked into my eyes as she licked her juices off my fingers, oh God. This impatient, mysterious stranger is too much to resist – I have to have her now, immediately. I take off her jacket, all the better to hold and lick and breathe in the scent of her skin, then lift her onto my lap. She’s so light and pliable, even in the cramped backseat of the car there is room for her to ride me, legs pressed together to better squeeze the length of my shaft as I finally—gloriously—get to plunge it in.

\n\nI am so desperate for it I rush through that first beautiful moment when my dick enters her, feeling the whoosh of pleasure as the head, then the whole shaft, gets enveloped by her pussy. It’s urgent now—so urgent. For both of us. That’s the beauty of this fantasy. As soon as we finally get to fuck, we’re desperate and yearning and so so hot for each other—teasing and pleasure has given way to an animalistic need to tear into each other. I grab the cheeks of her arse and use my own strength to lift her up and down, bouncing her on my cock like she’s a toy, letting her focus on enjoying the ride. And oh how she enjoys it! She grinds and squirms against me, working her hips and arse to get the best angle on my dick, enjoying how I stretch her out and fill her up and slam it nice and deep inside her.

\n\nMy mystery woman leans back against my chest as she rides me, and I feel the heat of her body pressing down on my chest even as I continue my vigorous thrusts up into her. Those earrings brush against her neck as she bounces on top, and she’s close enough for me to lick her, bite her. That red bodysuit only barely contains the jiggling flesh of her tits, and her legs are spread good and wide so I can plunge in over and over. It’s an ecstatic assault on all of my senses—the scent of her skin and post-orgasmic cunt mingling with the sensations of her bum slapping against my thighs and those beautiful high-pitched mewling noises that she makes each time my cock slams home.

\n\nFirst frantic, then slow, then frantic again. Building the rhythm up and down with the surges of blood thumping through my rock-solid erection. As I picture this fantasy vividly in my mind, it’s almost like the speed of our fuck matches the ebb and flow of the traffic as I drive down the motorway. I keep my eyes on the road, of course, but my concentration is heightened by the tension of my dick in my pants. In my mind’s eye I can picture her on top of me, breasts now free of the taut red straps of the bodysuit, bouncing rapidly as we fuck like rabbits on the back seat of the car. Leather on my naked arse, her warm skin slapping against my thighs, and now the view of her bent over in front of me, leaning into the front seats of the car. She places her hands either side of the gearstick for purchase so she can fold herself in half and give me the perfect view of my cock sliding in and out of her. The wetness of it. How tightly it stretches out her cunt. How prettily she jiggles while we fuck.

\n\nIt’s getting too much now—too cramped in the car. The space we have isn’t as much as I need—I want to plunge in slowly with long, firm strokes. I want to stretch out and lean back to drink in the view of her. No, not ‘want’ – need. I need this. She needs it too—in fact I’d say she’s greedy for it.

\n\nWe get out of the car, throbbing with this need and greed and hunger. I’m still naked from the waist down, cold air tingling on my skin, and now she’s almost entirely naked—that teasing red bodysuit now no more than a belt around her waist as we’ve shoved it down to get a more thorough view of her tits and arse while we fuck. God, she’s gorgeous. She has these beautiful small, dark nipples that stiffen in the chill breeze, and her arse is smooth and perfect, presented at exactly the right angle as she arches her back and braces herself against the car door.

\n\nWhen we resume, she takes the lead to begin—pushing herself back onto me, craving that sensation of me stretching her out again. Aching for another orgasm, which I’m desperate to give to her in turn. The rushes of my own are coming fast, but I don’t want to give her my cum just yet. I want to make the most of this frantic fantasy: I hunger too. For the sensations that I felt round my fingers when I fucked her with my hands—those crushing clenches of her cunt as she comes, taut and hard around the head of my dick. I like to hear those gorgeous, plaintive gasps of pleasure that she huffs out in time with the strokes, showing him just how much she appreciates what I’m giving her, and I want them to reach their crescendo. Against the car, she rides my dick like this, shoving herself back onto me as I grip her slim waist and yank her harder back, faster and harder until I’m so close I need to slow down.

\n\nHolding her tightly, I pin her in place exactly as she stands—back arched and bottom pushed out—and I switch to long, firm strokes. Slow and hard, in and out, at just the perfect angle for me to watch my cock sliding in. Lit by the headlights in the wooded clearing, I can see the shimmer of her wetness coating my dick. I’m panting now too, joining her in vocal appreciation of what we’re giving each other. And it does feel like I’m giving her a gift—you can be sure of that. I’m sure of that in the way she moans in agonised delight at every single inch as I slide myself in good and hard. Even more because of the way she uses one of her delicate hands to grab the cheek of her arse and spread it wide.

\n\nThat’s the part I love most of all—how desperate she is to enjoy every single atom of my cock, opening her body to me and spreading herself and making all those gorgeous moaning noises to highlight how much she loves it. Open, inviting, urging me to keep going. Giving me a better view of how hard I am and what I’m doing, as if to thank me for delivering what she wants.

\n\nI’m panting now too, joining in with her as we build to a climax. And oh God oh God how much I love the sound of her coming. The crescendo of moans and pants underscored by the rhythmic spasms in her cunt as she starts to ride those waves of ecstasy. I grip her tighter with my hands even as her cunt clamps tightly to my dick, and at that moment I realise I’m going to come too. I’m going to come all over this stranger, right here in the woods in the dark, up against the car. Feet in the mud and mind in the gutter and dick so deep in her it’s almost as if she might swallow me whole.

\n\nI can feel the first twitches of my cock about to start so I pull out—quick—and rub myself through those first spasms, painting thick ropes of spunk all over her smooth, round bum. One after the other after the other—so much cum. Shot after shot of it, landing in wet splashes all over her cheeks, thudding from the tip of my cock and draining me of everything I have left.

\n\nAs I get my breath back, the abiding image that stays with me from this fantasy is the sight of her naked arse covered in cum—my cum—shining in the light cast by the headlights, glistening on the bare skin of this mysterious stranger. And oh God what better way to brighten up a long journey at night in the car than reliving this fantasy over and over? I can’t think of a better one.

\n\nWill I ever meet this fantasy woman? I doubt it, but I can dream. And in the meantime I can enjoy the way it makes my cock throb while I’m driving, the echoing cries of her eager pleasure inside my head, and the filthy flash-frame images of her perfect arse painted with my spunk. Then finally the wolfish smile this cryptic woman flashes as she puts her trenchcoat back on, hops into my car… and drives away into the night.

\n\nIt didn’t take long to for us to become lovers. Within a month of being flatmates, we had our first drunken kiss, and after another month or so, we ended up in bed. And we’ve pretty much stayed there since.

\n\nLast night, as we were curled around one another in rumpled sheets, my fingers playing at her hip bone, Silvia told me about Steve, a friend from the States. He was passing through town tomorrow on his way to London.

\n\n“He asked to stay here,” she said as she snuggled back against me, the heat of her bare thighs distracting.

\n\n“That’s fine,” I replied, pulling her close. I kissed her neck.

\n\n“Well,” she stalled as she twisted her head to offer more skin. “You should probably know that we were lovers.”

\n\n“You and Steve?” I mouthed the words against her flesh.

\n\n“Uh-huh,” Silvia moved against me, her arse circling on my lap.

\n\nMy fingers walked the path from her hip to her knickers, then slipped beneath the fabric. She was already wet.

\n\n“Tell me about, Steve,” I said, two fingers tracing the edge of her vulva, back and forth, feeling the velvety warmth of her arousal. I pressed my chest to her back and pushed against her with my hips.

\n\nSilvia’s breath was fast. Her hand went to her nipple, pinching it through the fabric of her PJs. “We’ve been lovers for years,” she moved against my fingers like she was trying to get them inside her. Not willing to comply, I took them higher, circling her clitoris as softly as I could, my skin barely making contact with hers.

\n\n“Tell me more.”

\n\nShe was panting. “I… I don’t know…” Silvia tried to push her clitoris against my fingers, looking for a release, but I pulled them back, making her wait. “He has an amazing cock.”

\n\n“Does he?”

\n\n“Yes.” She swallowed and my fingers dropped to her clitoris, swirling around the glans before dropping to feel the wetness of her slit.

\n\n“Do you want to fuck him and his amazing cock?” I whispered the question into her ear, darting my tongue to her earlobe just as I pushed two fingers into her depths.

\n\nSilvia’s eyes closed, and I watched the pleasure wash over her. I started to pull out, and she whimpered, causing crazy things to happen in my body.

\n\nIn one move, I rolled her onto her back and pinned her body down with my own. My fingers went deeper into her pussy, and I braced my knee against the back of my hand, giving me better leverage as we fucked.

\n\nI kissed her hard on the mouth and began to move against her. Within only a few moments, she was bucking, meeting me thrust for thrust, trying to pull my fingers deeper into her cavern. Her nails scraped down my t-shirt covered back, and I nipped at her lower lip, drawing it between my teeth, then letting it go.

\n\n“I asked you…”

\n\nThrust.

\n\n“If you wanted…’

\n\nThrust.

\n\n“To fuck him.”

\n\nI curled my fingers towards her tummy, right in that spot I know makes her go crazy.

\n\n“Tell me.”

\n\nShe was close to cumming and struggling to find the words. I could feel her swelling, and her pussy was squeezing me tight.

\n\n“Silvie…” I whispered as I pressed my body into her, my mouth tasting whatever skin I could reach. “I’d love to watch you fuck him.”

\n\nAt those words, trembling started deep inside her, then radiated out like a sound wave, rocking her body against mine as she fisted her hand into my hair, clutching me to her. I helped her ride it out, stroking her internally as I let off the pressure of my palm on her clitoris.

\n\nAs she stilled, I rolled off, again pulling her with me, and she settled on my chest. I stroked her back as her breathing returned to normal.

\n\nEventually, Silvia spoke up. “Were you serious back there?”

\n\n“When? When I asked you if you wanted to fuck him? Or when I told you I’d love to see you do it?”

\n\nShe raised herself onto her elbow and looked at me.

\n\n“Both.”

\n\nI stared back at her. “Yes.”

\n\n“To which one?”

\n\n“Both.”

\n\nAt that, Silvia dropped back to my chest.

\n\nA full two minutes went by without a word.

\n\nI had to break the silence. “So do you?”

\n\n“Do I what?”

\n\n“Do you want to fuck him?”

\n\nShe looked at me, her face serious. “Only if you do it with me.”


\n\nSo that’s how I found myself sitting in the darkness of my bedroom doorway, watching my beautiful, sexy-as-fuck girlfriend ride her lover.

\n\nI knew I would be working late, and I figured starting a lovers threesome with a stranger would be a bit too awkward for my style. I texted Silvia and told her not to wait for me. That I’d join in when I got home.

\n\nNot wanting to leave me out of the fun, she sent me flirty updates all day, letting me know that she talked to Steve and that he was game, telling me when they got back from dinner. I received the last message about 15 minutes before I left the office, informing me they were moving to the bedroom and that I should hurry my arse back to the flat.

\n\nWhich, of course, I did.

\n\nWhen I got home, I was met with a treasure map of sorts. A trail of clothing led from the living room to the front of our bedroom. And there, right in front of the door, which was left just slightly ajar, was a chair.

\n\nI smiled as I slipped out of my skirt and heels and settled into the chair to watch the show.

\n\nSilvia and Steve were already at it. Silvia sat across his lap. Her eyes were closed in ecstasy as she slid forward and back on his cock. Her favourite vibrator, a wireless wand, pressed hard against her clitoris.

\n\nIt made me smile.

\n\nMy girl wasn’t messing around.

\n\nMy hand started its navigation of my body, my fingertips sliding across the skin of my arms and legs as I watched her move against him. She was braless in a striped button-down shirt, and her nipples were visible and rock hard.

\n\nI must have moaned in anticipation because Silvia’s eyes opened and immediately met mine. She smiled knowingly.

\n\nUnable to handle it any longer, I stood and walked through the door, closing it behind me. I waited a moment, watching her take pleasure from a man, something I hadn’t yet been lucky enough to witness.

\n\nBut Silvia didn’t let me linger for long. Using a finger, she called me to her. When I got within her grasp, she reached out and pulled me in, forcing me to climb atop Steve before she crushed her lips to mine.

\n\nThere was no time wasted incorporating me into their lovemaking. Steve slid my knickers to the side. He used my hips to guide my pussy to his lips as Silvia pulled my sweater off, wrapped her hands in my hair, and held me to her, pressing her wand harder against her clitoris.

\n\nTired of being teased by her hard nipples, I unbuttoned her shirt and lowered my head to her breast, pulling it into my mouth while my hands roamed.

\n\nWithin minutes, Silvia’s movements changed and I knew she was climbing towards her climax. I held her, kissing her neck before making my way to her ear. With my lips pressed against her, I whispered, “You are so bloody beautiful right now,” then I drew her earlobe between my lips and teeth.

\n\nThat was all the encouragement Silvia needed. Her hips started rocking, and her arm reached out to clutch me to her as the orgasm surged through her body.

\n\nAs her peak waned, she moved the wand away from her and brought it towards me. Craving her taste, I reached out and licked it. The sweet and musky flavour of her cum flooded my mouth.

\n\nIt was enough to send me into a ravenous fit, and my mouth crashed into hers, teeth clashing as I pressed against her.

\n\nAt her suggestion, we switched, and Silvia lifted herself off Steve’s cock. I straddled his waist and slid down on his dick, gasping at how full he made me feel.

\n\nAfter just a few strokes, I was bouncing, excited and aroused from watching Silvia cum all over him. And when I heard her coo from whatever it was Steve was doing to her pussy, I couldn’t help but pull her to me, press my mouth into hers, and smile against her lips.

\n\nSilvia’s hands were everywhere on me, caressing my breasts, pinching my nipples, gripping the flesh of my arse. My pace quickened, and Steve’s hands came to my hips to help me keep rhythm as Silvia distracted me with her mouth on my neck and lips.

\n\nShe leaned forward, taking my nipple and nipping it with her teeth, then moaned into my flesh from some pleasure spot Steve must have been hitting with his mouth. I arched into her, pushing my breast further between her lips.

\n\nI reached behind to braced myself on Steve’s thighs, my hips circling, making the full length of his cock massage me.

\n\nSilvia pulled my knickers to the side and watched. As if entranced, she reached out, touching us where we joined, and I started riding him harder, watching her watch us.

\n\nThe sensation of her fingers on my stretched lips was almost overwhelming. And, a moment later, when the heat of her tongue pressed against my clitoris, I came undone. My body stilled, and Steve took over the thrusts, allowing me to stay in one place while Silvia lapped at my pussy.

\n\nWhen she looked up at me, her face wet with my juices, emotions flooded through me. I took her face in both my hands and kissed her, knowing that I needed to taste her pussy and taste it right now. I slipped off of Steve and rolled onto my back, pulling Silvia and her beautiful cunt to my lips.

\n\nAs she climbed atop me, Steve tugged my knickers off and knelt between my thighs to have his feast. We all slowed, taking our time to enjoy each other’s pleasure. I buried my tongue in Silvia’s folds while Steve mouthed the whole of my cunt, causing me to gasp and groan. Silvia slid off me, her hands massaging my breasts and holding me tight as she watched Steve lick and suck my pussy.

\n\nShe smiled at me, then said to Steve, “I want to make her cum.” Silvia climbed onto her hands and knees, her mouth finding mine in a passionate embrace. As I bent to kiss her breasts, she had me lie back, giving her access to my pussy.

\n\nNot one to be left out of the fun, Steve made his way behind Silvia and, admiring her exposed arse and cunt, licked her from hole to hole. I watched as she pushed back against him encouraging him to fuck her. Standing, he took his cock and stepped between her legs, sliding it between her lips.

\n\nSilvia didn’t let his fucking interfere with her mission to make me cum. With a broad tongue, she licked me from slit to clit, slow and steady just the way I like it. My eyes closed. My head dropped back as the pleasure overwhelmed my senses.

\n\nMy hands found their way to my breasts, cupping them and squeezing my nipples. My orgasm was building, and I reached behind Silvia’s head, holding her in place.

\n\n“Don’t stop. Please, don’t stop.”

\n\nThe pace of Steve’s fucking increased, and I could feel his thrusts through Silvia’s mouth, lips, and tongue as she worked me towards orgasm.

\n\nMy fingers threaded through her hair, gripping it as I pulled her in closer to my cunt. I knew my moans were getting loud as the pleasure grew, but I couldn’t help it. I opened my eyes, looking at Silvia devouring my pussy, then at Steve, fucking her doggy style, his fingers digging into the flesh of her hips as he pushed deeper with every thrust.

\n\nIt was all too much. Silvia’s tongue lapping at me. The movement of the bed. The groans and moans. The sounds of skin sliding against skin. Steve fucking Silvia. Silvia fucking me. I crested the peak, then tumbled over the edge, my head falling back as the orgasm wracked through me.

\n\nWhen my body quieted, I leaned in to kiss Silvia, my tongue flicking across her lips, tasting myself.

\n\nSteve’s fucking quickened, and I knew it would make Silvia cum. I deepened our kiss and, as Steve thrust into her, he moved her against him, slamming into her pussy. My fingers reached out and grazed across Silvia’s breasts, pushing her over the edge as she pulled her mouth from mine, calling out as an orgasm coursed through her.

\n\nI watched in awe, holding her, touching her. While I’d given her similar orgasms, I’ve never been in a position to witness her in the throes of passion. I watched her face transform from a look of agony, her body movements rough and jagged, to bliss, motion soft and smooth. By the time her orgasm ended, she had a look of hazy glee and what I can only describe as complete contentment.

\n\nIt was bloody beautiful.

\n\nShe was beautiful.

\n\nThis was beautiful.

\n\nAnd I realised it just then. I loved this woman.

\n\nOur eyes met, and I smiled and kissed her.

\n\n“You’re amazing,” I whispered against her lips.

\n\nShe giggled, and we kissed again.

\n\n“One more orgasm for you, too, Venera,” Steve said, leaning in to break up our entanglement.

\n\nSilvia took that as her cue and slipped from between us. Before I knew what was happening, Steve grabbed me by the thighs and pulled me towards him, hooking my knees over his arms and pinning me to the bed.

\n\nI purred as he dipped his head, a hand on each of my wrists, and kissed me full on the lips. My tongue darted out to tease his, and I felt the warmth of Silvia’s mouth on my breast.

\n\nPleasure washed over me, and I surrendered to it. My head fell to the bed, and I gave in to the sensations of Steve’s mouth moving down my body. His tongue caressed my skin, leaving a trail on his way to my pussy.

\n\nWhen his lips reached their destination, he took the whole of my cunt into his mouth, sucking it until I cried out. He stood up, pulling my hips with him so that my arse was in the air, knees falling towards my ears, my pussy on display.

\n\n“Fuck,” Steve groaned as he stood above me and pushed his dick into my wetness. His cock rubbed against my g-spot, and pleasure jolted through me. Again and again, he thrust, and again and again, my pleasure grew and spread.

\n\nThen Silvia’s mouth was on me, her tongue licking at my clitoris, sucking it between her lips. When her mouth moved to where Steve’s dick and my pussy met, he pulled out and sank it into Silvia’s mouth.

\n\nShe licked around the head of his dick, then took him between her lips one more time before returning to my pussy. Steve joined her there, his mouth coming to play at my arse, licking my hole and teasing its entrance while Silvia teased my slit.

\n\nShe took her time, sucking and licking, licking and sucking. With both their mouths on me, I couldn’t tell who was who or differentiate one mouth from another. I didn’t know who was where or doing what or how and it didn’t bloody matter because this threesome all felt so fucking good.

\n\nWhen my orgasm bubbled up, it took me by surprise, not crashing into me like my last one but flowing from me and surrounding me in an abundance of joy.

\n\nWhen I recovered, Silvia’s tongue danced across my clitoris and Steve’s cock filled my pussy. His pace was fast, and I could tell he was close to coming.

\n\nI wasn’t disappointed. A few moments later, he pulled out, leaving my pussy gaping, his hand stroking the length of his cock. Silvia’s mouth left my pussy and opened for him just as his orgasm peaked. I watched as her lips wrapped around his erection, and he rode out his climax, leaving cum dripping from her lips and onto my cunt.

\n\nLetting his dick drop from her mouth, Silvia gave my pussy one final kiss for the night, and the three of us untangled from one another and made our way under the sheets.

\n\nAs we settled into bed, I chuckled. “You know, you were right about Steve, Silvie,” I teased. “He does have an amazing cock.”

\n\nAnd we lay there, all together, a tangled satisfied knot of lovers. It was perfect.

\n\nWhen my fiancé first sent me to spend time with George, having given me a free pass to enjoy the body of a man I coveted, I thought it was a trick. It was not my suggestion but my partner’s, though he’d obviously noticed me eyeing up George. At first, I thought maybe the French way of life had rubbed off on Alex, but then I got suspicious. Was I not enough? Did I still have much to learn? Was George to be my teacher? These were my thoughts at the time.

\n\nGeorge is a work acquaintance of my fiancé, as I understand it. He’s older than me, considerably, and also older than my fiancé. I’ve never quite understood their friendship, if it is indeed that. For all I know, they could be lovers too. Who the heck knows? I’m pretty sure they’re not, but the mind goes into overdrive around people like George who’s entirely impossible to pin down. I’ve even wondered… is George actually some kind of escort? Perhaps he and my partner aren’t friendly at all. At work parties, George is always there, but is that because someone has paid him to be? He never seems to truly mingle, just stands there on the periphery… broody as fuck.

\n\nIs George someone most men send their wives and girlfriends to? For training?

\n\nNo! It can’t be. No training has ever taken place between myself and George. From either side. We’ve never needed training. Together, we’re electric. That scares me. I’ve wondered if I was originally sent to George for something like sexual training, but then, we discovered by accident a connection.

\n\nIt terrifies me how much I’ve grown to adore him, in just six months of us occasionally fucking.

\n\nNot just adore him.

\n\nI’ve fallen in love with him.

\n\nI’ve no idea what to do.

\n\nIt’s that mysteriousness he has. I know nothing about his work—or life, come to think of it. He could be married for all I know. My fiancé is a banker and I’ve always assumed George is in the same field or something like that—but we never discuss real life.

\n\nWith George, it is always physical. Yet I am certain any affection I held for my fiancé before George has disappeared, replaced by some feeling I now have for my mystery man. My enigmatic and vindictive lover, whom I know very little about—aside from our blazing connection, of course.

\n\nI arrive at our meeting place in the quiet Parisian suburb of Saint-Cloud, recognising he’s already inside. The lights are on, there’s some music playing… but more than that, I just have a feeling. I let myself indoors and take my time in the hallway removing my coat, shoes, bag.

\n\nThe way he is always here at our rendezvous first always sets me on edge. This place is just some flat my fiancé rents for me, nothing glam, nothing like our place overlooking the Seine in Central Paris. I’m often in Saint-Cloud working late at the American School where I TEFL, mostly night classes for adults. Often, I’ll catch a drink with colleagues or students after class, and sometimes, it’s nice to have a place to crash nearby so I don’t have to board a train or bus at silly o’clock. Though in truth, the only reason I’ve visited this flat in the past six months is George. My home in the city is much more comfortable.

\n\n“I’m here,” he shouts, from the kitchen.

\n\nAs if I didn’t know. “Won’t be a mo.”

\n\nI’m delaying this and he knows it.

\n\nWe both know it.

\n\nI’m always the one to text George a time and yet, he invariably arrives here before me. Always in a suit. Tidy. Clean. Smelling great. I can already smell his musky cologne from several metres away.

\n\nI’ve never had the chance to go around the place and check for cameras or any other spying equipment. Sometimes it occurs to me that my fiancé is a voyeur. I don’t know. Maybe it’s George who has my fiancé over a barrel. Maybe it’s me who’s the fool and I’m being played by them both.

\n\nMore than once, I’ve wanted to ask George if he might meet me at a hotel in the city one night. Maybe he could stay the whole night then, so we might sleep together, fuck some more… hold one another. We could eat together, bathe together. Maybe I wouldn’t feel like I was being watched or assessed. Maybe he’d see me for what I really am, then fall in love with me, too.

\n\nThough I’m pretty sure George doesn’t love anyone. It’s not in his nature. Not who he is.

\n\nSometimes, I even fantasise about him taking me back to his place. A typical Frenchman, he’d have books and paintings stacked up everywhere. It would be chaotic. His fridge would emit a foul stench whenever opened, some cheese or other, and there’d be coffee granules scattered across sideboards, stacks of overfilled ashtrays piled up everywhere and too many empty wine bottles with candles stuck in them.

\n\nI stand in the doorway and watch him pouring wine into two tall glasses.

\n\n“Hey stranger.”

\n\nHe turns and glances, grimaces, then recommences pouring.

\n\n“Hello, Elena,” he says gruffly. “How was your day?”

\n\nHe knows I speak French perfectly well, but he insists on us always speaking English. My fiancé is an Englishman, and doesn’t know much French, so maybe he needs to be able to understand what his fiancée and her lover are saying through the microphones hidden around this place.

\n\n“It was fine. I had a good day, George. How about you?”

\n\n“Ah, you know…”

\n\nHe seems completely indifferent about his day.

\n\nAfter we’ve both taken our first sip, I try to put my arms around him and kiss his mouth, but he pulls away and does that thing of pretending he has to wipe some wine away or something.

\n\n“What’s wrong?” I ask, shaking, petrified.

\n\nHe’s shaking a little, too and it’s disconcerting.

\n\n“We can’t anymore, Elena. I’m sorry.”

\n\n“Can’t you even look at me?”

\n\nHe turns his back to me, his glass meeting the sideboard. He hunches over, his back muscles bulging as he splays his arms, clutching the edge of the kitchen counter like he’d fall over otherwise.

\n\n“You know why, Elena,” he grunts.

\n\n“I don’t know why.”

\n\n“You do. We both do.”

\n\nShit. It hits me, full and squarely, right in the centre of my chest.

\n\n“Has he said something?”

\n\n“Non!” he shouts, losing his cool for a second. “No. This is… me… you… us. It can’t go on.”

\n\n“Why did he want me to do this? Did he do this before? With that tart he was engaged to before me. Had you done this before? For him? Tell me!”

\n\nI’m getting brave. Up to now, I’ve never dared ask… but the man virtually just admitted he feels the exact same way I do.

\n\nHe turns around, picks the glass up and takes back a big, long draw on that red wine there. Then he grimaces, again. Stares at me. Licks his lips. Tries not to look at my breasts, but does so anyway, and even has to jiggle his leg in response.

\n\nHe looks haunted as he confesses, “I asked him. At that party. Where we first saw one another.”

\n\n“I remember.” George had looked so broody that night, so French, so boxy in his grey suit, so large and imposing and male.

\n\n“I asked him if it was serious between you two.” He shrugs.

\n\nI throw my hands up. “Frenchman!”

\n\n“He said he’d asked you to marry him, but only because he knew he’d never find anyone better.”

\n\nThat stings and George knows it. He abandons his wine again and comes flying at me. I wrap my arms twice around his head and cry freely as he kisses me deeply, his stubble rough, his scent all-consuming, his kiss fiery and desperate.

\n\nI love you.

\n\nWe wrap our arms tight around one another.

\n\nIt’s the truth.

\n\nWe’re in love.

\n\n“I thought I might borrow you for a while,ma petite but now I find I want you all the time.”

\n\n“I love you.”

\n\nHe yanks himself backwards, shocked by my admission. “Non.”

\n\n“Why not?”

\n\n“No, cherie. We cannot. Your fiancé is a powerful man.”

\n\n“I don’t care. He can go fuck himself. I haven’t fooled myself he doesn’t fuck around when he knows we’re together. After the first time I fucked you, he never said it, but he insinuated he’d entertain himself the nights I’m here with you.”

\n\nGeorge winces, angered. “He knows I love you. He’ll use it against me.”

\n\n“I don’t understand, George, please! I can’t go on pretending… you’re all I want. Let me show you.”

\n\n“The bedroom, then,” he mutters, “do that thing I like. I’ll need something stronger.”

\n\nHe fetches a bottle from the liquor cabinet and a glass, following as I lead the way. Just the look in his greedy eyes has me soaking my knickers. I thought I was alone in this, but now I know I’m not—I feel like maybe I can finally be myself.

\n\nI start my striptease in the bedroom, carefully removing items of clothing as he sits opposite the bed, observing.

\n\nDid I break this hulk of a man?

\n\nHe looks broken. Untethered, but also shackled, because of the feelings which he now cannot deny.

\n\nTo know I might have affected this beautiful man… makes me even more hot for him.

\n\nHe’s drinking heavily. It’s been a bad day for him. What happened in his job?

\n\nOr was it the thought of having to face me, seeing as though I requested his presence by text early this morning, giving him the whole day to stew on how he was going to behave tonight?

\n\nThe thing is about George, it’s almost criminal not to fuck him.

\n\nFor an older guy, he’s always rock hard and has the thickest, most delicious root. He tastes great. And he loves to lick pussy. Until I come and come and come.

\n\nHowever, he loves to watch me dance and play with myself, too. It’s one of our things. I always dance until I can’t stand it any longer and need him to see how much I want him—tonight being no different.

\n\nI stand up and bend over so he can see everything as I remove my knickers. He needs the proof, too—squirming in his seat, getting hot under the collar, agitated and impatient. I toss my knickers at him and he gets that proof—bringing my knickers to his nostrils.

\n\nI undress down to my stockings and suspenders and finger myself on the bed as I stare at the bulge in his tight trousers. I’m swollen and wet. I open myself up so he can see how much. My nipples are so tight, they’re stinging. His bottom lip is wet, his tongue keeps sliding out of his mouth to stop himself drooling, but I can see the necessity and need in his eyes—no matter how hard he tries to act cold and aloof.

\n\nHe takes another drink and I lie back, stroking my breast at the same time as feeling inside myself for the way he’s got me engorged and wet.

\n\nThis is the part where we never talk. It’s all in the eyes. He wants me but enjoys the delay, the anticipation. I enjoy that he’s fool enough to try and prevent what is inevitable. I also tease him, tasting myself… when I know my taste is all he wants right now.

\n\nGeorge always greets me with his tongue whenever we fuck. It’s how it always is. He licks me until I’m bucking my hips and pushing his head away with my hands at the same time. Sometimes there’s a toy he’ll use, too before his cock has even penetrated me. Which reminds me…

\n\nI take out my toy and jump when it first touches my sensitive clit, buzzing a million nerve endings that are desperate to be set free. Somehow though, I’ve got to control myself. George owns my orgasms. I want him to have them.

\n\nI almost come several times, watching how he’s licking his lips, swirling his liquor around that glass.

\n\nI bite down on my lip, hold my breath and deny myself pleasure, starting to sweat because I’m holding in so much heat and tension, barely controlled.

\n\nWhen he notices me succumb a little, crunching around the toy as it accidentally grazes someplace inside me that is unbearably aroused, he grunts and pretends to be displeased—but I can tell he’s enjoying how hard I’m working to not come, and also, how it’s just impossible not to because of how much I want him.

\n\nI leave the bed and sit on the floor, his prey, his submissive, my stockinged foot reaching out and finally easing the burden between his legs, his breath hitching when we first make contact.

\n\nI tell him with my eyes how I feel, what it is I want, and how there’s only one way this is going to go…

\n\nWith us ending up together.

\n\nI fuck myself with my vibrator, deciding he needs to see me like this. To know that I can pleasure myself without him. I have all I need right here. I’m spread open, a constant invitation, but he watches—the pupil having become the teacher. I tease him again and again, tasting the thing he craves more than anything—that first taste. I fuck myself silly, almost to the point of multiple orgasms, when I see a change in his demeanour.

\n\nWith one sharp lift of his chin, he lets me know what he wants.

\n\nI climb up onto his lap and nerves get the better of me as he holds me between his spread legs, his body cradling mine. I can’t help but tremble at his touch.

\n\n“Je t’aime,”he whispers as he’s nuzzling my nape.

\n\nI grab his hair and pant when he licks my erect nipple. I need him to take me to the edge and beyond, because I trust him with my body and need to feel that he trusts I know what I want.

\n\nHe slides his fingers into my mouth and I prepare them, wetting them with my tongue. I urge his hand between my legs and sigh, finally getting what I really want—his touch.

\n\nHe pumps his fingers in and out of my wetness, sending me crazy. The touch of a man! Oh god. So strong and unforgiving.

\n\nFor the first time, George is showing me he doesn’t just enjoy my pleasure, he requires it, lives for it and is precious about it.


\n\nI add my hand on top of his, encouraging him deeper, more, don’t stop. He gives me the sweet taste of my arousal and I feel his erection throb against my thigh even more as he watches me taste what he desires most of all.

\n\nThen he digs his fingers back inside me, greedy and depraved and thick, opening me up as he hits the spot and sends me spinning out of control. Sometimes there’s no orgasm deeper than the one he gives me with his hand because he’s all about me, giving me the firm caress I desperately want. Unyielding and rough. His masculinity teasing at my feminine tenderness until I can no longer bear it and need to respond to all the ways in which he can touch me like this, intimately, unforgivingly, manipulating all of me.

\n\nHe fucks me harder, faster and I push his hand in deeper, aiding him as I arch and cry out, pummelling around his fingers, drenching and coating them—all the tension in the centre of me finally released, until I’m floating on a cloud, pulsing.

\n\nWe share a look. He seems shocked. Delighted. More amorous for my orgasms than ever.

\n\nI love how sexy I feel when I’m with him. The very first time we were together, he showed me myself in a new light. I never needed him to be able to love myself, but I’ve seen what he sees and now I like it even more. How my body can be the vehicle for us getting closer, and closer.

\n\nI would usually be ravenous for his cock after my first orgasm, but today, all I want is this feeling. We cuddle up and I sense he needs time as much as I do. To reflect and find his strength again.

\n\nI pull his lips to mine and kiss him tenderly. “Love you.”

\n\nHe rests his face on my shoulder, catching his breath, tugging me tighter and closer. I wrap my arms around him and drown in the peace and contentment between us.

\n\n“I’m his fixer,” he says eventually, and my stomach turns to ice. “I offered to do a job for free in exchange for you, but he said I could have you for nothing. Something about you both needing one last affair before marriage.”

\n\nA long time ago, my fiancé Alex told me he has a fixer and explained what it is that his fixer does. I never put the two together, though. His fixer apparently blackmails, tortures… manipulates, coerces, sorts stuff out, gets the job done. I wouldn’t like to think murder is involved, but perhaps it is.

\n\nAlex owns his own concern and doesn’t like competition. He’s ruthless. I once believed I could change him. I was wrong. I think I knew when he loaned me to George that I was never going to marry him. It was clear to me then I’d got involved with a monster and would likely not escape.

\n\n“He’ll use that against you if we go off together,” I murmur.

\n\n“He’ll give me up to his enemies. I’d be dead in twenty-four hours.”

\n\n“Oh, god.”

\n\nGeorge holds me tighter and trembles against me. My big, strong, ruthless brute is scared. His fear terrifies me. It means Alex is even more evil than I thought.

\n\nMy brain goes into overdrive, thinking… thinking…

\n\n“I’m ashamed I was ever in love with him, but when I first got here, I was lonely. I was struggling to settle in. He was a Brit abroad like me, he seemed familiar. Like home. He had money. I didn’t have anything. I was sharing with six other girls… and I… I didn’t know better.”

\n\n“Sshh,” he says, kissing my cheek. “I’ll find something to hang around his neck, and we’ll get out of here. If you still want me?”

\n\nI turn and look at him, finding his doubt incredible. “How could I not want you? Though I hope you will give it up and never go back.”

\n\n“I swear,” he says, “on my life.”

\n\nI start opening the buttons on his shirt and kissing his neck. He immediately gets rock hard in his trousers.

\n\n“We’re going to make love. All night. Then, tomorrow, I’ll go back to him, pretend everything is okay.”

\n\n“Okay,” he says, his voice weak.

\n\nI nibble his ear as he’s undoing his belt, pulling down his zip and freeing himself. I turn to face him, straddling his body, then slide down on his perfect, full, fat cock.

\n\nPanting, I whisper, “My aunt died a couple of months ago. Alex doesn’t know. She left me a house. It’s safe. He has no idea I came into money. No idea I intend to leave. We can go there. I won’t pack a big bag. We’ll just leave.”

\n\n“Okay,” he murmurs, as I begin to grind. “Just so long as this never stops, Elena.”

\n\n“Never,” I groan. “Never.”

        <item>

\n\nChloe gets off the tube where she’s been instructed. At street level she checks directions on her phone. Her heart quickens, she takes a deep calming breath. She must not be late.

\n\nOh my God, am I really doing this? she thinks in slight panic. Yes, keep going, I can’t back out now.

\n\nShe walks past some suited city workers, standing around quaffing pints, cocktails and prosecco bathed in early evening sunshine, laughing jovially. It adds to her feelings of elation, knowing that they couldn’t possibly guess what she’s about to do.

\n\nThat’s because she’s about to get a beating. She’s going to get spanked. She’s willingly offering her ass for punishment. Yes, she’s going to pay a visit to a Professional Dom, a BDSM Master.


\n\nUntil a month ago Chloe was in a long-term relationship. However, she’d gradually realised that she was living a lie—so bored of the staid perfunctory sex she had with Charles. Yes, on paper, it seemed perfect. He was handsome, well off and a kind and caring man. But she couldn’t settle. She felt increasingly unfulfilled, yearning for excitement that did not materialise.


\n\nShe’d begun to have some very specific fantasies—she thought constantly about being tied up, about enduring pain, about her body being used and abused. She came to a startling realisation that she was absolutely desperate to be spanked, hurt. To have her hair pulled and to find out what it was like to submit to someone. These shocking thoughts had filled her waking moments while her dreams became progressively vivid—salacious imagery of ropes, leather, whips, chains, slutty strappy bondage outfits and gags.

\n\nYes, gags—this was what excited her the most. The thought of being physically incapacitated, bound was one thing, but to be silenced too, unable to respond or express herself, forced into holding her screams back.

\n\nOh my God!

\n\nThese thoughts drove her wild until she’d tried to share them with Charles. He had merely laughed in an embarrassed fashion, shutting her down. She felt the pain of his judgement and was unable to admit to him how fundamentally important this felt to her.

\n\nShe was surprised by the lurid scintillating detail her brain concocted and for a while, tried to suppress these intense thoughts.

\n\nHow can she ignore these incredibly visceral scenarios which bubble out of her conscience? This is a calling—it comes from a place deep inside the core of her sexual being.

\n\nShe can’t recall exactly what awakened her initial seed of desire. But now it’s germinated and grown into these powerful predilections she simply has to act upon. She vividly remembered seeing some images of Shibari, the beautiful art of Japanese rope bondage and was captivated.

\n\nShe’d begun seeking out alone time with some very specific erotic porn. In secret, of course, stolen moments before Charles got home from work or while he was out with friends. She delved deeper and deeper into a fantasy world of dungeons, latex outfits and threesomes… Her eyes startlingly opened to the existence of an incredible mind-bending array of tools in the BDSM world, things she’d never thought possible.

\n\nShe’d braved it, and after long deliberations on a kink website, she’d finally clicked and purchased a vibrator with an anal attachment, a small flogger and a ball gag. The days before they arrived were tense with hot anticipation. The innocent-looking, plainly wrapped box finally came. She’d had to sit down as she opened the package. Her hands trembling with overwhelming desire, her lace knickers soaked with her swollen cunt’s juices. She’d lain down on her bed, fully clothed, too impulsive to waste time undressing, her skirt roughly yanked up.

\n\nShe gasped as she inserted the ball gag. Its chemical silicone taste filled her mouth completely and most unfamiliarly as she tugged her panties to the side. She pressed the thrilling buzz of the vibrator onto her clit. She came almost immediately as the thrum of her toy made contact—hard, long, forceful shudders filled her whole body as she bit down hard into the ball gag and gulped through her suppressed groans.

\n\nOh, My, Fucking, God, this is better than I could have imagined! she thought happily, riding the waves of euphoric bliss.

\n\nLater, she was compulsively scrolling websites selling stripper shoes and boots when a small innocuous-looking ad popped onto her screen. She held her breath and stopped in her tracks.

\n\nYes, this is it! Why didn’t I think of this before?

\n\nShe fired off an email before she could change her mind.

\n\nThe next day Chloe checked her inbox impatiently several times before it arrived. His email was down to earth, welcoming and straight to the point—yes Master S was available and more importantly had offered her some dates.



\n\nHer excitement is almost unbearable, she has had these agonising fantasies interminably—months since her first thoughts. Now, today she is taking charge of her own destiny. She is quaking equally with a sense of power and vulnerability with each step she takes closer to her goal.

\n\nShe finally arrives at the doorway, it looks so innocent—a pale blue door with an entry phone as he’d described. But is she ready for punishment from Master S?

\n\nShe could be arriving at any kind of appointment, but this is no dentist surgery. She rings the bell, there’s a cheerful “Hello,” and she is buzzed in. The lift ascends. She checks the time, realising with horror that she’s six minutes late. The walk took longer than she’d allowed for in her heels.

\n\nThe lift door slides open, she steps out nervously into a penthouse apartment which affords stunning views over the city. Master S is unexpected—shorter, plumper than she’s anticipated but he has a gentle demeanour and an attractive face with bright kind eyes which twinkle as he smiles. He steps over and greets her warmly. He’s smart but casually dressed in a crisp white shirt, relaxed and smiling. She is instantly relieved as he seems genuinely pleased to see her. He offers her a drink, a soft one and then suggests heading down to his ‘dungeon room’.

\n\nNo messing about, straight down to business, she thinks.

\n\nOver a few emails, he had gradually put her at ease and reassured her of his professionalism and expertise. His credentials and experience in the kink scene as a both an educator and respected authority gave her confidence that she was in good hands. She bared her soul and admitted her desires. Specifically, about the ball gag fantasy, she’s been having…

\n\nThe room is bright and well-lit with rich red walls and velvet drapes. He ushers Chloe in and invites her to look at the equipment. Dominating the room is an imposing portable wooden St Andrews Cross. Next to this is a spanking bench he has set up with hand and ankle cuffs waiting suggestively. Chloe’s chest tightens, and her knees weaken.

\n\nIn the corner is an ornate plush red and gold double seat.

\n\nHe winks at her. “You’re going to be sitting in that shortly, you have an important task to complete,” he says.

\n\nWhat does he mean? Chloe ponders. But she doesn’t have time to dwell as he brings her focus to the adjacent wall where there is an impressive rack. On it displayed neatly are implements and devices used for impact play—the tools of his trade.

\n\nThis is a different world indeed—lots of sex toys. There are whips, riding crops, floggers, spanking belts, paddles, canes—thin, and thick, heavy and light, leather, metal, wood, glass. An impressive arsenal.

\n\nShe looks more closely and spots some metal devices which she guesses are nipple clamps, as well as hoods, dildos of varying sizes and colours, chains and butt-plugs.

\n\nThen she sees the row of ball gags. Her gasp is audible.

\n\nHe has noticed her reaction.

\n\n“Are you alright Chloe?” He kindly, knowingly checks in.

\n\nShe nods, unable to speak, as if already silenced. He talks to her in a relaxed manner, overlooking her obvious twitchiness. He begins to explain how this will work, asking her about safe words and so on.

\n\nHe looks her in the eye. “Now, I’m going to warm you up a bit first before your special task.”

\n\nHe begins by demanding that she removes her skirt and blouse.

\n\nShe is suddenly daunted and intimidated, but she quickly complies—undoing the zipper allowing it to drop to the floor.

\n\n“Do it neatly!” he commands.

\n\n“Oh, y… yes, of course, sorry!” Stammering, she can hardly articulate.

\n\n“Sorry, what? Young lady, I need your respect.”

\n\n“Sorry, Y…Yes, Master.”

\n\nHer eyes downcast, she flushes with embarrassment. He had explained in his emails that she must show deference and address him as ‘Master’.

\n\nHe had also checked her clothing preference. She picked out a black lingerie set which complements her lithe shapely body. She glances down at the satisfying curve of her breasts.

\n\nBreathe, she commands silently.

\n\nShe thrills inside, hardly able to believe this is happening.

\n\nHe first bends her gently over the spanking bench. She is demure, does as bidden. She shudders a little, not from the cold, no—excitement is building, nervous quivers flood her.

\n\nStay calm, Chloe grounds herself.

\n\n“I will use a variety of implements on you,” he tells her. “Do you mind being marked?” His voice deepens with a serious tone.

\n\nIn a quiet wavering voice, stippled with nerves, she answers, “No, no, not all, Master.”

\n\nShe inhales in deeply. She’s ready.

\n\nHe expertly ties her hands and ankles onto the bench using leather restraints. Faced down, hot anticipation is swelling in her chest, almost spilling over like an avalanche.

\n\nNext, he places a blindfold over her eyes. It’s an amazing one—confusingly, she can still open her eyes fully, yet she is in complete darkness. This sensory deprivation immediately heightens her awareness. She feels his fingers deftly unhooking her bra, her back exposed now.

\n\n“Now pick a number between one and five.”

\n\n“Two,” she says, feeling cautious.

\n\n“Ok,” he continues, “you were six minutes late, so two times six is…?”

\n\n“T… twelve, Master.” She pants. Oh my God, I didn’t get away with it! Realisation hits.

\n\n“Yes, good girl, that’s how many strikes I’m going to start with. And you are going to count.”

\n\nOh. My. Fucking. Goodness! I’m melting already, this is so hot, he’s so masterful, in control. Her thoughts run away with her.

\n\nChloe loves this power dynamic—she softens, submits, mentally giving in to him as she feels the first whack.

\n\nIt’s overwhelming—unfamiliar, this relinquishment of control. But it’s more potent, more all-encompassing than she’s foreseen. Her skin stings as she almost forgets to count.

\n\n“One!” She breathes.

\n\nShe assesses. Surely most people would find this utterly terrifying, but I trust him. She’s almost shocked to realise she is ‘in role’ so quickly and comfortably.

\n\nWhack, the noise sings out against her ass.

\n\n“Two,” she says quietly. The impact really is so hard. I can take this. She breathes inwardly, deeply.

\n\nI can say no or stop this at any time…

\n\nShe is ultimately empowered by choosing to do this. But she is also under his control, giving up her power and her body. It’s such a strange alien, conflicting feeling as she is usually dominant and authoritative in her ‘real life’.

\n\nThis is so freeing! she thinks.

\n\nHe begins to whack her with a heavier flogger.

\n\nShe counts, focusing her mind on the intense sensations, the energy in the room, the sounds and her breath. In between strikes he drags the many soft thick suede fronds across her back, buttocks and legs sensually. This feels intimate and almost caring. He isn’t rushing this process, and bizarrely she feels like a Goddess.

\n\nThe weight of the flogger on her back is surprising. It knocks her very breath away. Its force reduces her to a mound of flesh, muscles, sinews and bones being subjected to this punishment. It’s humbling but at the same time, it’s exhilarating, so life-affirming, and she’s now breathing into the pain, riding the waves of happy hormones that begin to overcome her—engulf her.

\n\nChloe continues counting dutifully.

\n\n“Are you ok?” He checks in with her.

\n\n“Yes, Master, I love it! Thank you, Master.” She sighs euphorically and continues to count as the flogger continues its efforts on her skin.

\n\n“Louder, keep going.” His masterful voice cuts through her consciousness.

\n\nIt’s now taking all her concentration to focus on the numbers, as though they don’t make sense at all.

\n\nAre we near the end of this or just beginning? She feels confused and entirely discombobulated.

\n\nChloe’s fully immersed now, at the same time sinking and floating. If she stopped to analyse, the strangeness of this it could be too much. But she is totally at one, it comes to her—this is a homecoming, an arrival.

\n\nIt’s over. He’s stopped.

\n\nShe hears his voice as she re-joins the present.

\n\n“Where am I?”

\n\nHe gently releases her shackles and helps her stand from her prostrate position. Removing the blindfold, he walks her over to the red and gold chair.

\n\nShe shivers, awash with emotions and the hot red sting on her surely glowing ass. He holds her by the shoulders and checks in again. She can feel the prick of hot tears stinging her eyes, blinking them back she nods, and he hands her a sheer black top.

\n\n“Put this on.” He commands.

\n\nShe struggles slightly but manages to get it over her head—she is covered, but only just. Her nipples and breasts are clearly visible, pert and provoking.

\n\nHe bends down to her level and looks into her eyes kindly, causing a dichotomy of feelings to course through her.

\n\nHe takes a band from his pocket and gently pulls her hair into a ponytail, some stands of her hair left loose, framing her face. Again, there is that intimacy.

\n\nNext, from his pocket, he slowly retrieves a black ball gag. Her heart accelerates.

\n\nThis is it! She quivers with dawning comprehension that he is about to realise her ultimate sexual fantasy.

\n\nHe places it gently into her mouth, staring into her eyes intently as he secures it behind her head.

\n\n“There. Well done, Good Little Slut! You’re ready for your task.”

\n\nHe walks over to the chair he has pulled over and sits down, facing her.

\n\n“Now, you are going to show me how you pleasure yourself.”

\n\nHer heart beats almost out of her chest, pounding with the possibilities and excitement of this.

\n\nIt’s daunting, intimidating. She’s never done this, not for anyone. Faltering, her whole body peppered with nerves, she answers with a shy nod—unable to utter words now her mouth is so obscenely occupied.

\n\nObediently she starts to touch her legs, tentatively trailing her fingers over her thighs.

\n\nHe sits opposite, drink in hand almost leisurely, nodding slowly with encouragement.

\n\nSpurred on, she gasps and glances up at him, looking for reassurance. Although he doesn’t smile, his expression beams approval.

\n\nFuck, this is so hot!

\n\nShe strokes herself, her fingers dawdling gently across her skin—finding her suspender garter, she pulls it up and then releases it teasingly.

\n\nSnap, it’s a satisfying sound. Chloe is really getting into her stride now.

\n\nShe leans forward in the chair, continuing to caress her legs. Her confidence builds—she is enjoying this, a lot.

\n\nLuxuriating, she rests her hands on her knees as she gazes down, feeling suddenly coy again.

\n\nBreathe… I can do this. Chloe turns her head slowly to one side, brushing her hands up and down her legs. She focuses on the sensations, pleasure mounting. As her hands delicately stroke her inner thighs, she looks at him and repeats these movements teasingly.

\n\nTake your time, you’ve got this, she thinks, composure regained. She leans back, her head supported against the chair. She starts rubbing closer to her groin. Her rhythm builds, and tension bubbles up as she releases audible pants.

\n\nShe looks him in the eyes as she rubs her breasts, stroking them provocatively, her hands move down, pressing her clit rhythmically through the lace of her pants.

\n\nCheekily she flicks the strap, enjoying the sting of the elastic.

\n\nHe sits impassively, holding his drink and slowly swirls the liquid in the glass as he watches her little show attentively.

\n\nShe glances at the table and reaches for a dildo which has somehow materialised. Perfect timing as she’s desperate for penetration. She pulls her knickers aside, and teases her moist slit with the cold hard rubber of the toy.

\n\nRecently she has enjoyed making herself come in front of a mirror. The sight of her own thigh pulled up, exposing her dripping wet cunt drives her insane with desire. The way it anchors her, but it’s also as if someone else is controlling her. Her limbs are not her own.

\n\nShe does this now, clenching her thigh tight, knowing that Master S has maximum view—this thought is a huge turn-on.

\n\nWhen did she become such an exhibitionist? This is so exhilarating. Huge waves of pleasure escalate as she finally thrusts the dildo deeper and deeper into her wet folds. Her pulsating clit throbs under her fingers as she quickens. Her breathing is hitching and rapid.

\n\nOh my God, am I actually going to come? Chloe can’t believe how filthy and wrong this feels, but yet so right. She begins edging herself, feeling the rushes of hot passionate want coursing through every cell. Her gasps are becoming so loud now in spite of the silicone cramming and muzzling her mouth.

\n\nShe can’t contain her saliva, which drips wantonly and uncontrollably from her lips, hot wet viscous spit slides down her neck.

\n\nFuck! This is unbelievable! She has an out of body experience—erotic images of herself in this degrading defiling position flash through her mind, yet she is owning this.

\n\nThis is it! Oh. My. Fucking. God….!

\n\nShe increases pace. Furiously plunging her depths now, rubbing and gyrating as the beautiful crescendos climb higher and impossibly higher. Her heart is thumping with such force it’s virtually exploding out of her body. Her hips undulate uncontrollably with exquisite waves of this all-encompassing, utterly consuming, pure primal desire.

\n\nShe can’t stop now even if she wanted to.

\n\nShe unravels. She melts. She retreats within and submits entirely. Her body bucks, her thoughts liquify, she judders and writhes in a frenzy of pure unbridled lust.

\n\nShe eventually recovers and calmly stands up, in control again. She walks over to him and speaks humbly.

\n\n“How did I do Master?”


</item>
        <item>

I knew it was going to be an interesting night when our friends started a conversation about current good reads, and some s &amp;
\n\nm erotica came up.

We were speaking of fantasy books, then supernatural stories, which of course led the way to Anne Rice,
when it so happened someone mentioned her Sleeping Beauty trilogy.
\n\nOf course, having read all three, it got me squirming to my core, and for the rest of the night, I couldn\'t stop thinking about it.

They left early, around 9:30, and he and I were left alone.
I was so aroused, I could feel my wetness soaking my panties.
I went online, looked at some sites, and although they helped, it only brought more of a flush to my face.
\n\nI looked over at him, sprawled on the couch, and of course, by this point he was mostly naked, as was I save for my tank top and thong.

He was almost hard; erect, but not fully so.
I crawled over to him, and from between his legs I looked up and asked \"may I lick you Sir?\" He nodded,
and I took him all in my mouth, to the point where I gagged on him repeatedly.
I let his length withdraw almost completely, and then clamped my lips firmly around his tip,
swirling my tongue as if his cock were a popsicle, alternating between sucking hard, and teasing flickers of my tongue.
As I did this, he grabbed himself and started pumping the rest of his length as I suckled on the head of his cock,
slowly rubbing and caressing his balls.
My hand moved down, still keeping my eyes on his, sucking hard,
I pushed a finger against him, slowly pushing it in, feeling him open around it.
I bobbed my head now, more frantically, my tongue and finger both working away at sensitive spots.
I withdrew my mouth, and started telling him how I wanted him to cum so hard,
and with more pressure of my finger, he exploded all over his chest.
He moaned with the orgasm, his chest heaving, his breath coming in ragged gasps.... I retrieved something for him to clean up with,
and asked innocently if that\'s all the play he wanted tonight.
\n\nHe told me to be patient, that I would get mine soon enough.

I went back to the computer, and he switched on the tv, and we were content for a small while to relax.
But I couldn\'t stop thinking about pain, bondage, and hard fucking.
I kept thinking about the books, about the hall of punishment, where naughty girls were strung up, bound and exposed,
\n\nand teased and fucked until they couldn\'t cum anymore.... the thought of it was more then I could bare.

I was so flushed I felt dizzy, and I crawled back to him, nuzzled against his chest, and told him what I craved.
I wanted, needed him to tie me tightly, gag me, shove something in me, and then let me suffer alone for a while.
I rubbed myself against him, telling him I needed pain and control so badly.
He rolled me on to the floor, onto my back, and told me that I would be a good slut,
and collect all I wanted and have it ready for him, with one condition:
\n\nI was to cum ONLY from having my tits pinched and tortured right then and there. I agreed.

He pulled my plain white tank top down over my tits, my nipples already alert, ready for his touch.
Knowing how sensitively I react to having my nipples twisted and pulled,
he went to work without mercy, until i was either in screaming agony,
or screaming ecstasy, and my pussy shuddered, wanting to be filled.
\n\nI lay there gasping. He whispered in my ear to go prepare my toys for him.

Perhaps I was over eager, but letting me choose my torture proved that I only made things worse for my poor body,
as I salivated over my 10\" glass dildo, my nipple clamps, my hog-tie cuffs (which I attached to both wrists and ankles)
\n\nmy ball gag, and the paddle. I assumed my position (face down, ass up) on the bed, and called to my Master that I was ready for him.

He entered, and swiftly had my pussy filled.
He did not remove my thong, only shoved it aside as my toy entered me,
and then fixed it so that my toy could not slip out as my thong held it in place.
My hands and ankles were connected, and when he pulled down my tank top,
my nipples were clamped (which, since I was on my stomach, had my full weight pressing on my already sore tits).
\n\nLastly, he had my lips wrapped around the ball gag and positioned me in the middle of the bed. He slapped my bare ass a few times, before turning off the lights, leaving me whimpering and squirming on the bed for him.

What felt like an hour later, with my tits aching, my pussy BEGGING to be fucked, and saliva running down my chin,
I heard the door open.
He came over to the bed, and I felt his weight upon it.
I turned my head to look at him, but he savagely gripped my hair and shoved my face down,
and commanded me not to look at him.
I whimpered in response, and stayed still and mostly silent.
He began to run the paddle over my body, running it between my legs, over my ass, up my back,
only to bring it down sharply on my exposed ass. He randomly spanked me, and started pumping my dildo in and out of me,
working me up to climax, which I had been so close to all along.
I got almost to the brink when he stopped. I could hear a \'click\', and a wet sound.
I tried my best to not turn and see what he had in his hands, but with the lights out,
\n\nI don\'t think I would have been able to make out the next toy he was about to use on me anyways.

I understood as soon as he pressed the lubed up tip of the butt plug against me.
I had been able to take this one before, but I had been pretty fussy, as I\'m pretty much an anal virgin.
But being bound so completely, without even being able to voice my fears,
\n\nI simply raised my ass for him, and he slowly pushed it in, all the way in, until I moaned with what he knew was renewed arousal.

He told me he was pleased I took it so well, and began pumping both the dildo and plug in and out of me,
making lewd comments about how I had both my holes filled.
I moaned and gasped and tried to control myself, and manage to choke out from behind my gag a request for permission to cum for him.
He told me to cum as hard as I could.
He pumped them harder into me, and I felt my ass and pussy so completely full and used,
I shuddered and slumped on the bed, gasping after such a release. Without warning, he savagely ripped out the dildo,
and got behind me, thrusting all the way into my sopping cunt,
and fucked me, telling me I\'m his whore, his play cunt, his toy to fuck however he wants.
Unable to move even if I wanted too, I moaned loudly into my gag, feeling my tits rub against the bed,
the clips pulling cruelly on my nipples.
He fucked me until I clamped down around his cock, shuddering violently.
\n\nI lay there, regaining myself, when he commanded I move lower down on the bed.

It felt near impossible, as even if I could shift being hogtied,
my tits rubbed too hard against the mattress, but he spurred me on with more blows to my ass.
I managed it, and he shifted so that once again,
I was on my stomach, but this time, replacing my toy in my cunt, and removing my gag, he shoved his cock down my throat.
This angle allowed me to take more of him, and what with his hands at my cunt again, rubbing my clit, pressing the plug deeper in me,
\n\nand grabbing my tits, I was vulnerable and useable, and I came with his cock deep in my throat.

At this point, he undid my feet from the hogtie, and told me to get on his cock.
I slowly but surely got on my knees, and straddled him, He removed my toy, and plunged himself in me.
My hands still bound behind me, the gag around my throat, plug still firmly in place in my ass and clips dangling from my chest,
he thrust up into me without mercy.
I began to beg that the clips were too much, and in one painful motion, he ripped them off me,
only to replace the vise grip of he clamps with his own two hands.
He mashed my tits, groping me roughly as I rode his cock to yet another climax.
He told me if I could cum two more times for him, he would let me ride him with my vibrator on my clit.
I cum the hardest when I grind my pussy against my vibe while riding him.
I oblige him, grinding against him, moaning, whimpering, gasping with the sensations, and he reaches for it.
I grind against him, feeling my ass and cunt full, both in me so deep, and my clit finally
rewarded with the steady buzz of the vibe, and my Master thrusting up into my used body,
I cum magnificently for him, and collapse beside him.
He undoes my hands, and tells me to rub myself off while he removes my butt plug to rub my ass.
I do, and he sprays his cum all over my tits and stomach, He too collapses besides me, and we pant silently.
My body burns from the pain and the pleasure and the vulnerability and from the excitement of being so used.
\n\nI clean him up, and we kiss gently.

\n\nI love nights when we have such inspirations...

        <item>
\n\nWith a sigh of relief, Lovita lay back in her stretchy hammock. It was dusk and she could finally get a chance to rest in the comfy fabric swing. It had taken her ages to put up, making sure it was holding tight. Then, getting in had been a bit of a tricky manoeuver too—she was achy from a full day of training clients at the gym. Luckily she had flexible limbs and a body that easily did her bidding, even when tired.

\n\nWith the tension of the day finally ebbing away, Lovita stretched her smooth legs, pointing her toes up. She could see the darkening sky, hear cicadas humming and she breathed in the fresh air. Lovita felt a bit like a kitten, luxuriating in comfort; she took in her surroundings peaceably.

\n\nHer pale skin matched the creamy hue of the hammock fabric almost perfectly. If she hadn’t been wearing her cute little jumpsuit she would have blended right into it. If she were naked, only her darker lips and nipples would stand out in the dim light…

\n\nIt felt delicious wriggling into the cotton fabric and getting cosy. Though her outfit actually felt a bit restrictive, now she came to think about it. Maybe she could loosen some buttons, get some air on her overworked body. Her pert little breasts were always eager to be free and Lovita figured that she’d positioned her hammock in a secluded enough area of her patio to get away with letting them out.

\n\nShe knew her local area well, it was quiet and she was comfortable enough in her own skin. Being naked was second nature to Lovita—she grew up in the countryside where nobody was around to judge or point fingers; her own bohemian parents never raised an eyebrow and she’d had lots of freedom.

\n\nLovita dreamily unbuttoned a couple of the delicate top buttons on her orange jumpsuit, pursing her lips into rosebuds as she did so. These little pearl things were so fiddly. The fabric opened up though, and her coral nipples escaped happily. She smiled at them—they were always so cheery looking when they were erect.

\n\nLovita rubbed a fingertip against each of her nipples lazily. Her eyes fell closed and her lashes fluttered. It always felt good to stroke herself—and the air had a little bite to it which was pleasant against her warm body. She was somewhere between feeling dozy and low-level horny. It was too late to take a nap though and too early to go to bed. Maybe she could have a moment of indulgence and give herself an orgasm as a reward for a hard day at the gym.

\n\nIt seemed worth marking —she’d taken on several new clients since starting her personal training business, and this week was the first with 100% attendance from all. A cold glass of bubbly would really hit the spot, she thought. Although it felt like a bit of effort to get up and grab a drink, she was happy to complete the perfect tableau.

\n\nExtricating herself from the hammock but not bothering to cover up her lightly bouncing breasts, Lovita padded through to her little galley kitchen, enjoying the feeling of grass and tile on her feet.

\n\nAs she poured from her favourite bottle into a crystal flute, she glanced idly at her bare toes. Her nails were painted a glossy shade and they reminded her of another glossy item she could do with…

\n\nMaking a detour to her bedside table, Lovita headed back to the jasmine-fragranced garden with some goodies in hand. She put down her flute and climbed daintily back into the hammock. Her aches were a distant memory—now that she had some frolicking in mind, she was all abuzz. The glass dildo she’d picked up was now warming up a little with her body heat.

\n\nThe wine went straight to Lovita’s head. It always did. She was petite and had no tolerance for alcohol but that’s what made it so fun. She lolled her head back and let the sensation of loosening run through her body. She licked her lips and ran her fingers through her silky hair, letting the dildo rest against her breasts.

\n\nShe knew she made a sexy picture; it would be fun to film herself one day. She could dress up in some outrageous lingerie and take some steamy erotic videos of self-pleasuring. Lovita liked thinking of watching her own face on film and in different positions—perhaps it was vain but she fully appreciated her own body. She worked hard to keep it just the way she liked it. Looking at herself in a mirror while she pleasured herself always made her come even faster. There was something incredibly erotic about watching yourself writhe in orgasm.

\n\nLovita let her fingers run down her body. Her nipples were tight and her belly button also felt sensitive. She was wet already. She always got extra horny when she drank. She pulled up the back of her jumpsuit to feel the lace of her underwear. It was such a hot sensation. She loved both leather and lace against her skin, but today had been a day for delicate underwear.

\n\nMaybe she’d wear her leather harness at the weekend. It would be appropriate for the hammock. Could she use it as a sex swing?

    \n\nGripping her large dildo Lovita giggled to herself. She dipped one end of it into her fizzy wine, then drizzled it into her mouth, one drop at a time. So naughty.

\n\nShe licked the tip with her dextrous tongue so that her saliva coated it lightly. There wasn’t any need for lube today.

\n\nShe pushed the glass against her nipples, feeling the stickiness of her saliva and gasped lightly. The coral nubs stiffened even more than they had before.

\n\nLovita worked her way down her body, squirming delightedly as the dildo glided easily to her eager mound. She knew her clit was swollen without even touching it and the combination of her fingers and smooth glass was perfect on it. She increased the pressure and felt the blood pump around her body as she started bucking around in the hammock.

\n\nThe movement of the swing was erratic and she lost herself in the sensation. A lack of control meant she wouldn’t come too fast. She liked to make it last. A long slow orgasm was one of life’s great delights and she wanted to savour it.

\n\nHer hair stuck to her face, momentarily distracting her. She blew a strand of it away and refocused on her pleasure. The toys she had were always fun to play with. The last time she’d used this particular dildo had been when she was being a bit of a perve with her next-door neighbours.

\n\nShe remembered the day vividly; it had been particularly cool for a summer evening and she’d run a bath to warm herself up—and to get a little frisky.

\n\nLovita had been inspired by the peek she’d got at her new neighbours. They were a hot lesbian couple and friendly too; as soon as they’d finished unpacking, they’d turned up at her door with a muffin basket to introduce themselves. You couldn’t make it up.

\n\nThe taller of the two was raven-haired and cute in a commercial way, big doe eyes and round curves that hinted at a deeper sensuality. The younger and shorter of the couple had darker eyes and multiple piercings. She was slimmer, with a dancer’s physique. They looked striking together, a wet-dream pairing and were even wearing matching denim shorts.

\n\n“Hi, we’re your new neighbours,” the tall woman had said. “I’m Maxie and this is Ling.”

\n\nThey had both grinned at her.

\n\n“Do you need a hand with anything?” Lovita had asked, knowing full well her offer of help was already too late.

\n\n“No, we’re all settled, thank you,” said Maxie holding out the basket.

\n\n“It should be me bringing you home-baking.” Lovita laughed while reaching for the muffins. Chocolate was a weakness of Lovita’s. And free pastries were a win since she hadn’t been grocery shopping for a while.

\n\n“These are wonderful!” She had taken an appreciative bite and nearly swooned. “Maybe I can invite you both for dinner once you’re a bit more settled.”

\n\nThey’d agreed to reconnect another time and Lovita had gone on with her day, feeling satisfied at the sugar hit. From her lithe body, you wouldn’t know she ate like she did. But Lovita was very grateful to have the metabolism she had inherited, and of course the career she’d chosen. Her perfect milky skin never broke out either.

\n\nLater that same evening Lovita had noticed she could see the neighbouring couple fooling around in their kitchen next door. They’d clearly been making dinner—various candles and spices littered the countertops—but that had been abandoned at some point when they’d started necking.

\n\nTheir kitchen was only dimly lit, but the view Lovita had from her downstairs bathroom window was unobscured. She wouldn’t have seen them unless she’d gone in just then to wash her hands which were a little sticky from another of the delicious muffins.

\n\nLovita was transfixed at the sexy serendipity; she’d lingered in the bathroom, feeling like a minx but enjoying the show they were putting on.

\n\nShe’d seen Maxie shimmy out of her own shorts before pulling down her partner’s. They’d both been wearing underwear that shimmered in the candlelight.

\n\nLing was wearing something gold that looked like a Brazilian cut, showing off her excellent ass cheeks, while Maxie was in more conventional silky panties. They both had gorgeous bodies and Lovita found herself pushing closer to the window, wanting to see what else would be revealed.

\n\nThe girls were French kissing deeply, up against a kitchen counter. Each of them were gripping the other’s bottom and Lovita imagined little noises of pleasure. She could almost hear them, gasping and moaning in heat.

\n\nLing had turned Maxie around now, so Lovita could see both their faces. Their eyes were screwed shut in ecstasy. Ling was rubbing her breasts against Maxie’s back and nuzzling the nape of her neck.

\n\nLing’s hands were sneaking up Maxie’s top—kneading her under the thin layer. It was alluring and yet unfair. Lovita desperately wanted to see this without the clothing in the way.

\n\nThen her prayers were answered and she’d gotten an eyeful of Maxie’s big, round breasts as Ling ripped off her faded t-shirt. They were encased in a green silky bra that matched her knickers. The bra had a balcony effect, making her boobs appear like they were about to fall out.

\n\nIt was mesmerising. Lovita wished with all her heart that Maxie’s nipples would pop out. Would they be dark? Would they look like chocolate chips?

\n\nBoth women’s hair was mingling as they continued to rub their faces and necks together. The dark strands of each were tangling sexily.

\n\nLing had kept on her halter-neck top but her hands were still massaging Maxie’s curves. She coaxed down Maxie’s green bra-straps until they fell limply to the side, and finally, gloriously, Maxie’s large teardrop breasts were exposed. They were heavy and luscious. Ling moved to Maxie’s front and half-kneeled so that she could kiss and lick those tight, sexy nipples. They were dark and Lovita had fervently wished she could be there too. To get a taste—to feel her own nipples graze against Maxie’s.

\n\nThey stayed in the kitchen for another few minutes, long enough for Lovita to get thoroughly over-heated. Her own hand had snuck into her panties and she’d been drenched. She’d been so turned on that she didn’t even know if she could wait to get comfortable before getting herself off. But her nature was methodical and she liked to do things leisurely, so she’d run a bath, her mind full of the delicious images she’d seen.

\n\nHer head almost couldn’t comprehend how sexy the scene her neighbours played out had been. She was going to remember and relive every moment. Lovita reached for her favourite dildo and climbed into the tub with it.

\n\nThe bath was steamy—perfect to counteract the chill of the night—and she envisioned herself in the kitchen with her horny-as-hell neighbours. The bubbles lapped at her soft skin and she let her imagination run riot.

\n\nWould they have invited her in if they’d seen her at her little bathroom window peeking at them? She loved the idea that one of them—Maxie with her gloriously popping out boobs perhaps—would have made eye contact and held it with her while her partner lapped at her. Starting at her large, sensuous breasts, moving down her flat belly and then maybe even licking her out. Lost in their private pleasure, but acknowledging Lovita’s presence with a sly wink at the end.

\n\nMaybe even after staring at them for a while, Lovita would have flashed them herself. She could have pushed her pinky-peach nipples against the cold bathroom window and licked her lips slowly, provocatively. They could have put on a mutual show, house to house. The idea was thrilling.

\n\nLovita was frustrated at missing the end of their sexy interlude. What would have happened in their bedroom, she wondered? She imagined that Ling would have been the one to continue the hard work of seduction. Maxie would have laid back in their large bed—perhaps they had silk sheets, the colour of red wine—and have been attended to.

\n\nLovita could see their boudoir in her mind’s eye. A string of fairy lights threaded through a four-poster bed. Dark, erotic art on the walls and some kind of heavy jazz music playing on the stereo. She would be a pervy fly on their wall. The girls would spread themselves out on the chartreuse sheets and move confidently through their scene.

\n\nMaxie on her back, in repose, Ling climbing all over her. They would start with just their hands and lips, enjoying the taste of each other, taking their time and exploring. Maybe later, one of them would gather some massage oil and they would rub each other with it. Ling would lie spread-eagled on Maxie and roll her entire body against hers, up and down, side to side slowly and tantalisingly.

\n\nOnce they were thoroughly oiled up, Ling would bring out a heavy hitter. A vibrator that was double-ended perhaps. One of those big, thick silicone jobs that could start off gently and then be adjusted according to how hot and rowdy they wanted to get. Lovita imagined Ling warming it up for Maxie. She could see in her mind’s eye how Ling would spread Maxie’s legs and nudge at her folds, exploratory at first, and then insistent in her need.

\n\nBoth of them would have heavily dilated eyes and would be gasping for breath. Maybe one of them would then open a window so that their sex noises would travel in the night air. Lovita loved the idea of that—catching the groans and keens of pleasure. It would be like getting an audio show to match the visuals in her mind.

\n\nShe imagined the vibrator again; half engulfed in Maxie’s wetness and waiting for Ling to mount it. She was slim and Lovita imagined that her dancer body would move as lightly as a feather. She’d rock herself onto the vibrator, delicately and then they would find a rhythm.

\n\nThe pulsing of the machine would be irrelevant as the two of them created their own speed and thrusting pattern. They would shake with impending orgasm and she could see how they would come in their individual ways. Maxie would be breathy and loud—“Oh, Oh, OOOh”—while Ling would make a noise like a mewling cat.

\n\nLovita in her bath that day, had delighted in the sounds and sensations she was imagining. She wished she were in that bedroom next door but still had enough pleasure in her present moment. Her own glass dildo was slick in the soapy water. It pushed and pulled at her pussy, creating a glorious suction effect.

\n\nHer body was reacting so strongly to the prolonged excitement. She loved how fully absorbed she was in her sex and gave in completely to herself. She shuddered magnificently to a toe-tingling peak, the bubbles sloshing slowly to the floor as she gave a low satisfied cry.

\n\nThe erotic high she had reached that day was skewered through with a sense of naughtiness; not only at the scene she had caught of the lesbians in the kitchen, but then also the fantasy she’d built up. The outrageousness of the whole situation still tickled her.

\n\nIn the hammock, Lovita took pleasure in reminiscing over the story she had built around the bedroom antics next door. The previous sensation of being cocooned in the hot bath water synced beautifully with how she was held now in the hammock fabric. Lovita held the memory tight and squeezed her pussy hard around the thick glass as her orgasm rose and ravaged her until she was breathless.

\n\nShe still had to invite the girls for dinner. She’d seen them a few times but only in passing. Maybe this weekend was the time to have them over. Have them over her sofa perhaps…

\n\nMy tits bounced out my t-shirt as I lifted it up over my head.

\n\nShuffling out of my knickers, I turned the taps off and stepped tentatively into the bath, my toes kissing the hot water as the steam rose up to greet me.

\n\nMmm, the perfect temperature. Goosebumps shivered over my body as I shuddered into the tub.

\n\nThe water caressed me like a skilled lover, my body relaxing and opening to the pleasure I was receiving.

\n\nMy pert, dark nipples puckered with the contrast in temperature. I raised a warm hand and clasped it around my tits.

\n\nI pushed my soapy breasts together and gave them a squeeze.

\n\nMmm. My pussy twitched with anticipation of things to come.

\n\nThe bubbles formed a necklace around my chest.

\n\nAs I lay back tweaking and stroking my frothy nips I thought of my best friend Lily’s voice clear as day.

\n\n“Be good to yourself please, Amy.” Her concerned voice rang in my ears.

\n\n“For fuck sake.” She clipped. “Slow down, start to be kind to yourself. You’re always on the go, thinking of everyone else. It’s like you have totally forgotten yourself!”

\n\nWe’d met for a quick coffee a few days ago. She’d joked it was an ‘intervention’.

\n\nI think it was a joke anyway. But I kept playing her words in my mind.

\n\n“No wonder you’re feeling like shit, when was the last time you danced? Laughed outrageously? We never have fun anymore!” she had said, almost pouting and it was beginning to sting. She was right.

\n\n“When was the last time you shaved your legs,” she spluttered, “let alone have an orgasm?”

\n\nShe’d reached over the table almost spilling my mocha and grabbed my hands. “You know, a proper, knee quivering, scream out loud orgasm?”

\n\nShe released me and rose to leave handing me a business card out of her wallet and winked.

\n\n“Do yourself a favour darling and ring this number. She is a friend of mine, Tara. She is a pleasure mistress. The most amazing massages!”

\n\nLily’s words had really triggered me.

\n\nShe was right, I had been stuck in a rut too long. I couldn’t remember the last time I’d shaved my legs, let alone the last time I’d had a proper full-blown orgasm.

\n\nWell, not one that involved anyone else anyway.

\n\nI had given up on the dating game last year after being disappointed and fucked over one too many times.

\n\nI have no idea where people find the time or energy to actually date!

\n\nDating sites in themselves I found to be quite a traumatic ordeal. Sorting through the hundreds of random freakin guys with slogans like, “Get in touch. I’m bored!”. What the fuck. Pleeease.

\n\nLathering my hands up with soap suds I slid my fingers in between my toes, squirming at the intense sensation.

\n\nRunning my hands up the insides of my parted legs, the water kissed my pussy.

\n\nAs my fingers reached my soapy thighs, I cupped my cunt and throbbed into my warm hand.

\n\nI slid my other hand underneath my bum, my finger gently circled my sweet spot.

\n\nMy buttocks tightened as I grabbed onto myself from both sides.

\n\nI wanted to make sure I was really clean.

\n\nI gently gave my pubic hair a tug.

\n\nSliding my fingers to either side of my clit, I squeezed them together and a shiver ran up my spine. Mmm. My clit pulsed begging to be touched, flicked, anything.

\n\nI picked up the razor and started shaving. Tonight was the night baby!

\n\nNervous excitement rippled up my body with a severe case of What the fuck am I actually about to do energy riding it.

\n\nI quickly grabbed the wine glass and downed the whole thing.

\n\nA mixture of cold white wine and hot water made my head spin a bit.

\n\nI turned the tap for a blast of cold.

\n\nFuck, Lily had been right. It had been so long since I had really thought of me and my pleasures.

\n\nWhere had my internal fire gone?

\n\nMy desire for fun and mischief.

\n\nSo long since I had felt hands on me, so long since I had been kissed and pleasured.

\n\nIt had been mere weeks since Lily’s get your shit together chat.

\n\nAnd I think that I’ve been doing really fucking well at turning my stale, no mojo, beige ship around.

\n\nLily will be well chuffed when I tell her how far I’ve come with my self-care practice.

\n\nLots of hot baths, dark chocolate and meditation.

\n\nAnd then yesterday—prompted by a very steamy dream, a broken vibrator and a few glasses of bubbly wine—I decided to step way out of my comfort zone.

\n\nThanks to Lily’s promptings I had decided to book a massage.

\n\nBut not just any old massage.

\n\nMy voice was shaking as I spoke with the amazingly sexy-sounding woman at the end of the phone. But I kept on talking and soon the quivering turned into an ecstatic buzz.

\n\nI told her of my deepest sexual fantasies and she moaned softly with honour and recognition. At the end of the call, she said that she had taken notes and was looking forward to making me smile and we booked the appointment.

\n\nMy toes curled.

\n\n She was going to be here soon.

\n\nI finished up and hopped out of the bath. Making sure I had rinsed all the soap suds off me. Soapy pussies are not tasty. And I wanted to be tasty.

\n\nI went into the kitchen and poured myself another glass of wine.

\n\nBrrrrringbrrrrring, my phone sang out. My heart jumped into my mouth. It was a text from her.

\n\nI am on my way.

\n\nMy eyes flicked to the clock, registering when exactly she’d arrive.

\n\nPut your front door on the latch and go to your bedroom.

\n\nSet your camera to record you as you lie down on your bed and blindfold yourself.

\n\nHer message made me weak in the knees.

\n\nI listened carefully to your fantasies. I promise to be gentle.

\n\nOh my goodness! I was trying desperately to think back to our phone conversation yesterday. What did I relay?

\n\nFuck I had been so horny speaking with her, the adrenalin rushing from my nerves turning into extremely heightened senses, that I couldn’t quite remember what I’d agreed to!

\n\nI know I spoke of loving anticipation and tease, kissing, photography, mystery, surprise. And women.

\n\nI had been in a relationship with a man for the last two years.

\n\nCelibate since we broke up six months ago. This reflection had made me realise how much I missed loving women.

\n\nThe soft-touch of their hands, their sensual mouths and warm small tongues that lap so well.

\n\nI found my best lovers to be women. They know exactly what feels good.

\n\nFuck! Half an hour!

\n\nGoing to the front door I put it on the latch and skipped up the stairs.

\n\nChecking I had enough battery to last a good while I set my phone up facing the bed, and started to record in black and white. My favourite way to film.
\n\nFinding a blindfold in my knicker drawer I lay down on the bed and wrapped the fold around my eyes. I tied up tight at the back, making sure that I couldn’t peek out the sides.

\n\nOh my. The excitement throbbed deep inside me. As I lay there with my eyes covered, all my other senses became heightened.

\n\nI could hear my heart pumping hard in my chest.

\n\nThe smell of my horny juices filled my senses.

\n\nMy pussy muscles clenched in anticipation of not knowing what was to come, other than promised pleasure, and the thrill of watching it afterwards.

\n\nI put my hands between my legs, stroked my freshly shaved skin and plunged a finger into my wet hot cunt.

\n\nLetting out a whimpered gasp, I shivered, fuck I was so horny and hungry.

\n\nBringing my fingers up to my mouth I sucked my juices from them. Mmm, I tasted good.

\n\nThe front door creaked open. And closed. The latch released and shut with a loud click.

\n\nThe pressure and build-up within my body was making me squirm on the bed.

\n\nHer instructions rang clear and sexy from the bedroom doorway.

\n\n“You are to stay still. No moving. Just surrender and receive. This is your time, for your pleasures.”

\n\nThe anticipation buzzed through my veins—my blood was pumping hard. I could hear movements getting closer, along the side of me.

\n\nMy breath caught in my lungs as the bed moved with the weight of someone.

\n\nMy senses were filled with a sweet sexy musky scent.

\n\nI was so tempted to rip the blindfold off my face.

\n\n“Don’t Move.” Came the voice again, assertive yet gentle.

\n\nGoosebumps crept up my body, my sexual energy was so high.

\n\nShe lightly fingered my skin, gently, sliding, up my body, circling my nipples.

\n\nThen her warm tongue on my breast.

\n\nMy toes curled and I squirmed under her touch.

\n\nI froze, startled as I realised that there was someone else working their way seductively up my legs.

\n\n“Don’t move,” she gently but firmly whispered again and pushed my arm to my side.

\n\n“This is Suzie, I am teaching her the art of pleasuring women. She is an eager student. Lie back and enjoy darling.”

\n\nHoly fuck balls! What the hell. This was such a surreal situation to find myself in. To actually drop into my full-on desires and really let my imagination flow. For that to not only be heard but acted upon. To be spoiled rotten with own my fantasies!  Lie back and be pleasured, she said. I wasn’t going to argue with that.

\n\nHands and mouths were all over my body. On my breasts and my legs, lips and ankles.

\n\nIt felt incredible being massaged and kissed at the same time, I ached to part my knees as she moved higher.

\n\nAs her mouth reached my pussy, a hot, wet tongue licked my lips. Having my mouth and pussy licked and sucked at the same time made me so wet.

\n\nThe pleasure rushed up my back as though the energy was dancing along my spine.

\n\nShe kissed me hard and sensually, nibbling my lip and stroking my tongue with hers.

\n\nMy mouth was filled with her stroking, sensual wet tongue probing me.

\n\nThe whole experience was making my pussy ache with desire.

\n\nTentatively, they played with my folds, teasing, fondling, stroking.

\n\nI pushed my cunt up and towards the fingers that started rubbing my bud.

\n\nI was practically dripping with desire.

\n\nHer hands felt so good, expert fingers massaged and stroked my cunt. I was aching for her. Catching my breath I shuddered. I heard kissing. Their tongues moving around, lips sliding. My pussy throbbed hard. Behind the blindfold, my imagination was going wild. Their mouths colliding, full breasts pressed against each other, both of them wet and horny from pleasuring me.

\n\nThe urge to rip off the bindings at my eyes was tearing through me but I pulled my focus back to my breath and calmed my nervous system the fuck down.

\n\nI didn’t want to come too quickly. This was golden.

\n\nGoosebumps ran up my spine, I so wanted to move, to thrust and grind, but I lay there like a motherfucking boss and took it, as I had been told.

\n\nThen all of a sudden there were four hands at my snatch.

\n\nTwo holding my hood back and pressing into my mound as the other flicked and rubbed me to perfection. The pleasure mounted in my stomach.

\n\nI stretched my legs wider, I wanted more. Deeper and harder.

\n\nLicking my lips, I let out a laugh and squirmed into my desires that were fast becoming reality. My mouth was craving to be licked, sucked, kissed. And just like that as if my mind had been read a mouth met mine. Sweet and full. Different from the other. This mouth must belong to the apprentice. She tasted good.

\n\nWhich meant that between my legs was the Pleasure Expert.

\n\nI can completely understand why she holds that title, I thought as she thrust her hand in and out of my hot, wet pussy. Plunging and stroking me all in one action, I have never felt that move before. My pussy squeezed tightly onto her skilled fingers.

\n\nArching my back, my nipple was sucked into a hot hungry mouth.

\n\nA whimper escaped my lips. My voice climbed higher, closer to climax.

\n\nA wet thumb suddenly rubbed my throbbing clit. I had no idea who it belongs to but to be honest, I didn’t fucking care. My body started to shudder, fingers, fucking, wet, thrusts into my shaved cunt. My breasts and breath heaved. I heard them kissing, this threw me over the edge of a crashing orgasm. My pussy pulsed and pumped at her fingers as I came all over her hand.

\n\nOh, my goddess, stars danced around my eyes covered in the blindfold.

\n\nI lay back in post-orgasmic bliss. The sensation of her climbing up my body from between my legs brought me back into my being. Her breasts pressing against mine, her mouth seeking mine out.

\n\nIn a flurry of tits and tongues, I was back in the room squeezing the most out of this divine surrender.

\n\n“Fingers.” I gasped. “More fucking, fill me with your fingers.” My pussy ached to be filled and fucked, screwed and shagged.

\n\nIt had been far too long. And I was on a roll. Four sets of hands worked at my creamy pussy. Flicking and stroking, strumming me like they were Slash from Guns n Roses and I their guitar. Rubbing and pumping and spitting and sliding. My tits were shaking, my whole body quivering with the sheer pleasure that was coursing through my being. I could feel my pussy juice flowing onto her hand as my muscles clamped down once more in a delicious orgasm.

\n\nOh my. Lily is my freakin hero. So pleased she gave me that boot up the arse to sort myself the funk out! I might even show her the sex video footage if she’s lucky.

\n\nI felt as though I was floating. I’m sure I was on the ceiling at some points viewing the horny scene in front of me.

\n\nAnd wowza, what a scene it was. I could only imagine.

\n\nNibbles graced my skin. Kisses and licks and gentle bites brought me slowly back to earth.

\n\nThe room had gone all quiet. All I could hear was my heartbeat. I couldn’t see anything behind my blindfold. Kinda wishing that I hadn’t done it up so tight but also loving the suspense and the mystery of the unknown.

\n\nThe thought of watching this back and discovering what my lovers look like caused a deep shudder of excitement to run through me. I mean, wtf!! My own, mystery sex scene, for my own future pleasure… or anyone else I should wish to share it with. The exhibitionist in me got a huge kick from the thought of watching and sharing my erotic intimacy.

\n\nOh my god! What the fuck was that? It sounded like a swarm of angry bees, a lot of them, whatever it was it sounded big. And I wanted to fuck it. God, I hoped that they were going to put that in me.

\n\nI opened my mouth to ask, no, to beg to be fucked but my requests were gagged with a tongue and hungry mouth playing with mine, wet, hot kisses.

\n\nI nearly shot off the bed as this buzzing beast caressed my cunt. The vibrations hit my clit full-on and practically made my third eye vibrate. Wowza! Goosebumps ran from my toes, up my shins, around my knees which were buckling like jelly. Up the backs of my legs like a tongue coursing its way up my body. Rippling, ripping through me. I pushed my tits up, my breasts aching to be squeezed and loved.

\n\nThey were greeted by a warm mouth and strong, small hands that held me down.

\n\nI didn’t put up much of a fight to be fair.

\n\nI couldn’t tell if I was being pleasured or tortured at times. Minutes felt like hours of divine, soul-nourishing pleasure. Being squeezed and cradled. Licked, held down and caressed. The joy ride was coursing through my body.

\n\nI wriggled and squirmed with pleasure and pain as this motherfucking magical staff pressed against my dripping folds.

\n\nThe constant stimulation on my clit was unreal, my juices were flowing, my hot cream running between my legs onto the bedsheets. Fingers were pumping in and out of my wet snatch. In and out, thrusting harder and faster into me. Filling my cunt up with her hand. That and the beast between my legs buzzing on my sweet spot made me feel like the mightiest, divine sex warrior queen.

\n\nMy body twitched and gyrated under the restraints of female domme energy and tongue lashing.

\n\nI pushed myself onto her, fucking her hand so deep, filling me up in such a fine way.

\n\nMy pussy pulsed around her fist as I came. Hard. Over and over.

\n\nFrissons of juicy orgasmic energy blasted through every cell in my being.

\n\nAgain and again I came. My silent screams smothered by kisses.

\n\nThe bright white light behind my eyes was blinding as I swam in that place of bliss.

\n\nWarm skin lowered itself onto mine, hot breasts pressed against me as I slowly grounded back in the room.

\n\nHot, wet kisses brought me back round, passionate, deep. Tender.

\n\n“Oh yessss you did,” a sultry voice purred in my ear

\n\n“That was so beautiful. You should be proud of yourself for stepping forward and listening to your desires.”

\n\nI breathed in the recognition and empowerment.

\n\n“Enjoy watching your pleasures darling, I know I did.”

\n\nAs the front door shut behind my guests, I floated on cloud sixty-nine, of blissful sovereignty, self-worth and divine feminine pleasure.

\n\nTaking my self-care practice to a whole other level never felt so good.

</item>
        <item>

\n\nShe knew he was going to be good. Just how good didn’t really matter. She had already imagined how his lips were going to feel against her mouth… how his firm, muscled body would feel against her soft skin… what he was going to feel like inside her… her imagination was plenty enough to get her juices flowing. The rest was really just details.

\n\nLike his name. She called him Romeo, but was his name really important? For that matter, was hers?

\n\nIt was all part of the plan. A spontaneous trip to an exotic island where no one knew who she was, or why she was there—the whys were always so complicated. Career not panning out the way it was intended… a string of exes that just didn’t make the grade… all of it was left behind in her small London flat she shared with three roommates, including her real name.

\n\nJasmine was the name she chose on her vacation. Jasmine was confident, carefree, and single. Jasmine’s only desire was to lay by the pool and drink tequila for a solid week. No phones. No social media. No texting with friends or late-night booty video calls with ex-boyfriends. Jasmine wanted to be alone, and answer to no one.

\n\nNo one, that is, except for Romeo.

\n\nJasmine first spotted the dark, handsome, stranger shortly after she checked in. He was sitting by himself, lounging by the pool in a pair of tight, white swim trunks and gold-rimmed sunglasses. She kept a curious eye on him, looking for a wife, or girlfriend as she took a seat on the outdoor couch opposite him across the private veranda. No one appeared. It was just the two of them, not a single other people insight.

\n\nRomeo was gorgeous. Tall, defined, with short spiked hair and smooth, dark skin the colour of chocolate that made her insides ignite. She immediately felt the urge to flirt with the handsome stranger and get to know him a bit better. In fact, that’s exactly what she would’ve done if she were alone on a typical vacation.

\n\nJasmine had other ideas.

\n\nJasmine didn’t care to get to know anyone a bit better. Jasmine was bold, and her pheromones were running wild. Jasmine tossed back a shot of tequila. She was ready to play.

\n\nStretching her legs out, she teased her white floral sundress up over her thighs. She casually caressed her smooth skin as she drank in her new obsession. He didn’t seem in any particular hurry to dive into the water or do anything other than just sit on the edge of the pool, soaking up the sun, which was fine with her. She could keep her eyes on his glorious body, watching the water drip down his defined abs all afternoon.

\n\nShe couldn’t however, keep from touching herself much longer.

\n\nJasmine shifted her legs on the sofa and pulled her sundress up over her hips. She was only wearing a tiny, barely-there pair of white panties. At any moment someone could come around the corner and catch her with her legs spread open, touching herself as she stared across the pool at a complete stranger. Daring. Bold. Utterly wrong—the exact sort of behaviour that a proper woman like herself would never consider back home, yet exactly the kind of behaviour Jasmine intended to exhibit on this vacation… and it was only the start.


\n\nA smile bounced its way back and forth between the two strangers. So far Romeo had yet to move from his position on the edge of the pool. It struck Jasmine that her new obsession might only be interested in spending the afternoon tanning his athletic body, or maybe he wasn’t even interested in women, although she didn’t feel that was the case. No, he was going to be interested in her soon enough, she was certain.

\n\nSure enough, like a bee finding its honey, he stood up and moved over toward her. They didn’t speak, at least not with words. His eyes drank her in, as her eyes did the same to him. She could feel him undressing her as if her sundress had disappeared in the blink of his eye as he gazed at her large, firm breasts, and her long, tanned legs. She had already admired his rippled muscles from afar, but now she, too, stared at his dark, defined body from just a few feet away, imagining what his cock would feel like if she held it in her hand, or what it would taste like if she were to slide it inside her mouth.

\n\nNothing, of course, she would ever consider doing back home. A complete stranger?

\n\nNever. Except she wasn’t back home. She was on vacation… and on vacation, there were no rules.

\n\nHe sat down next to her and leaned forward. She didn’t hesitate.

\n\nThey kissed hungrily. She stared into his eyes, hidden behind his gold-rimmed sunglasses as their mouths met. Their lips and tongues explored one another, her breath nearly extinguished with a simple kiss filled with a hunger and desire she had not experienced in a long time. She gave in quickly to the passion flowing through her, allowing her instincts to control her body’s movements. Her mind simply wasn’t needed.

\n\nHer arousal deepened as Romeo’s hands roamed and groped her body. His powerful hands moved to her neck, holding her like a possession. That was fine with her. She wanted to be possessed. She wanted to be taken, and ravished, and fucked beyond compare. She wanted this from the moment she saw him.

\n\nThey caught their breaths to share a drink, and confirm they were still the only ones in the secluded veranda. Maybe they did speak briefly. Maybe that was when he told her his name was Romeo, and she told him he could call her Jasmine. It was tough to recall. All she knew was that she wanted to hear him say her name as he plunged his cock into her, over and over again.

    \n\n“Oh, Jasmine,” she wanted to hear him groan. “You’re so beautiful…”

\n\n“I want you so badly, Romeo… I want to feel you in me, I want to feel your beautiful cock buried so deep in me…”

\n\nOf course, she didn’t say a word. Even Jasmine had her limits.

\n\nTheir drinks were set aside. They resumed kissing. This time their passion was fueled by a desire to take things much further. Both parties were consenting to this madness. Both parties were now an equal part of this instant attraction. There was no turning back.

\n\nRomeo’s hands moved to the top of her dress. He caressed her breasts through the sheer fabric. Her nipples were erect and throbbing as he lowered his head and slid his tongue up and down her neck. She moaned against him, her desire for this complete stranger increasing with each flick of his tongue on her skin.

\n\n“God, that’s so good,” she whispered. “I want you so badly.”

\n\nDid she really utter those words? Did he respond? Did they say anything the entire afternoon they were together? She couldn’t be certain.

\n\nHis hands moved under her dress. She spread her legs as his fingers found her panties and easily slipped past the flimsy fabric. She was shaved smooth in preparation for her trip, with just a tiny patch of dark hair. She arched her back and reached her hand toward his cock. She swung her long legs over his, giving him full access to her body. Touching at the same time, they began moving, pleasuring each other with the intensity that comes from knowing that soon they would be fucking, hard and deep. She stroked his thick, long cock as his fingers slipped inside her wet folds, already in a rhythm that felt familiar.


\n\nHe could make her come in an instant, she could feel it. Her inhibitions were gone, her pores practically oozing with her newfound sexuality. She was in heat, and the stallion she had selected was hers to ride. She wanted that, badly. Yet, first, she needed to experience just what her stallion had to offer.

\n\nLowering her head to Romeo’s lap, Jasmine pulled down his shorts and took hold of his cock. She held it in her hands, admiring not just his thick, hard shaft, but the body from which it came. His abs quivered under her touch. Beads of perspiration appeared on his skin… or was he not even sweating, and that was simply water from the pool? No, he was breathing heavily, his chest heaving up and down, as lost in the moment as she was.

\n\nShe could feel the control she held over him, his member pulsing in her hand. She held all the cards. She could get up, pull her dress back down over her hips and walk away, and return to her hotel room, satisfied with an afternoon makeout outdoor sex session. She could walk away without ever looking back, satisfied in knowing she could conquer any male she encountered on her vacation, with just a wink and a nod.

\n\nOr, she could tease her stranger, bring him to the complete edge, until he was so close to exploding she could feel his tip practically bursting, then simply pull away. She could request that he visit her later, and take her out to dinner, like a proper lady.

\n\nShe could do any of this.

\n\nYet, there was truly only one thing she wished to do. She wanted to fuck Romeo in the worst way. Here, now, in the middle of the afternoon on the veranda where they could be caught at a moment’s notice. She wanted to ride him until she came over and over on his glorious cock.

\n\nLeaning forward, she brushed her long, dark hair to the side and sucked the tip of his shaft between her lips. Swirling her tongue around his bulbous tip, she bounced her head up and down, enjoying the sheer girth that filled her mouth until she was practically gagging. Normally, she was not one to get too dramatic giving oral. She preferred to receive, or just accept a cock inside her as part of lovemaking. Jasmine wasn’t part of any normal rules. She was the vacation seductress, and Jasmine was an absolute whore when it came to giving head.

\n\nJasmine sucked Romeo’s cock furiously, working her tongue up and down his thick member. She moved to his balls, sucking his large sac into her mouth with no hesitation, enjoying the rough texture in contrast to the smoothness of his shaft. She couldn’t get enough of him. She was dripping wet, the aching need between her legs nearly impossible to bear. His hands continued to fondle her and tease her clit. He pulled her dress down, consuming her bare breasts and swallowing her nipples with his dark, luscious lips. He pushed her back against the cushions and moved lower, tasting her with his deviant tongue. She arched her back and groaned as he feverishly licked her clit and spread her open with his long fingers. She moaned loudly as she fought to regain control. She pushed herself up and moved her head back over the top of his cock, stroking his shaft as she licked up and down his full length, and ran her tongue over his balls. He stood in front of her as her head bobbed up and down, faster and faster, mimicking the movement she soon knew would be her body on that cock.

\n\nIt couldn’t come fast enough.

\n\nShe pushed herself up. Peeling her dress over her head and tossing it to the side she pushed Romeo back against the couch. Straddling his thighs, she lowered her body down onto his lap. His rigid staff nearly came up to her belly button. She took hold of his cock and lowered herself down onto him. Inch by inch he penetrated her. She gasped with pleasure as he began thrusting into her, pushing his cock between her lips, spreading her open. Her mouth moved down to meet his. They kissed again, hard, full and deep. He grabbed her hips, reaching behind her and squeezing the flesh of her buttocks, pulling her body to him until they moved together as one. She cried out as they held each other tightly, fucking in the sun-filled afternoon, with not a care in the world.

\n\nVacation sex. It was fucking perfect.


\n\nThey changed positions. She stretched her lithe frame across the couch, his lean, dark body tucked behind hers. To anyone walking by, they might’ve been simply cuddling in the shade by the pool, except they were both completely naked, and after a moment’s glance it would become apparent they had no intention of cuddling.

\n\nHe entered her from behind, pushing his cock between her slick folds and driving deep inside her. Jasmine gasped and closed her eyes. Romeo was no longer just a stranger she’d met on vacation. He was not just her lover… he was the perfect companion whom she’d had many times. He knew all there was to know about her. His hands knew the canvas of her body like only an experienced artist can know his muse. He knew just how to touch her, just how to stroke her in just the right way to make her explode. He held the key to her soul. There was no union more perfect than the one she felt right now, with him buried inside her.

\n\nShe pushed the familiar sensations away.

\n\nJasmine was here to forget, to experience something new. Romeo was not her companion. Jasmine would make certain of that.

\n\nFlipping around again she pushed herself down on all fours. She arched her back and thrust her hips back as Romeo took her from behind. Her hair blew wildly around her as his cock penetrated her, deeper and deeper with each thrust. Jasmine cried out, not caring if anyone heard her, or if anyone saw the two of them. Part of her wanted someone to come watch as she fucked her stranger, maybe even to join them. Wouldn’t it be wild? Jasmine truly had no limits.

\n\nJasmine did, however, had needs… and she needed to come.

\n\nShe rode him, bucking her hips against him as hard as she could. Faster and faster she fucked the tall, handsome man she’d just met without a care in the world. He flipped her over and she spread her legs wide, drawing him into her as deep as he could go. She sat on top of him, her naked body on full display as she bounced up and down, then returned back onto all fours. Any position she wanted. She was no longer concerned if he was going to come. She didn’t need to ask if he was going to spend the night, or if he wanted to go to breakfast the next morning. None of it mattered. All that mattered was that his delicious cock was buried in her pussy, fucking her brains out until she climaxed.

\n\nJasmine pushed her body up and pressed her hips back against his long, thick cock. She felt his hand on her buttocks, then his finger slide inside her anus. She rocked back against him as he penetrated her with his cock and his finger.

\n\n “Fuck, fuck, fuck… that’s the spot!” she cried out. “You’re going to make me come!”

\n\nHer body exploded. She screamed as the sheer pleasure washed over her, again and again. With his cock buried in her pussy and his finger in her ass she came and came. Her life she’d left behind was completely lost in the sea of bliss that consumed her. Her troubled exes. Her nagging job. Her untidy flatmates. All of it vanished as the woman known only as Jasmine screamed in ecstasy while Romeo fucked her through an earth-shattering climax, and then another, and then one more.

\n\nFinally, Jasmine caught her breath. She shifted around and smiled up at the perfect tall dark stranger that had brought her so much pleasure. It was only fair now that she provided the same release for him. She spread her legs and arched her back and moaned beneath him as he thrust into her hard, driving her back into the cushions as his climax built. Just as he was about to explode, he pulled out, then pumped his thick cock and ejaculated a stream of warm, white fluid on her breasts. She ran her hands over his torso until his seed was completely drained from his body. She pushed herself up and they sat back and held each other, a brief moment of intimacy that even Jasmine would allow.

\n\nShortly, they would go their separate ways. Jasmine would return to her suite, Romeo would return back from where he came. They would part as strangers… just as they planned.

\n\nIn another world, in another time, maybe they could’ve been strangers who had just met, who were so consumed by desire that they had to have each other right there, right out in the open in the middle of the afternoon. Jasmine would never know. Because as deeply as she desired to perhaps meet a stranger like Romeo in a bar, or encounter him in a dark corner of a dance club and instantly have her way with him, she knew it was never to happen.

\n\nShe was simply not that kind of girl.

\n\nRachel turned to Jared, with a deep, satisfying smile on her lips.

\n\n“What do you say we go back to the room and take a shower, then get some drinks at the hotel bar?”

\n\nJared smiled. “I was thinking the same thing.”

\n\nRachel reached for her dress as Jared pulled his shorts back on.

\n\n“Was that everything you hoped?” he asked her.

\n\nShe turned back with a smile. “Absolutely, my Romeo. I love you.”

\n\n“I love you, too, Jasmine.”

\n\nThey giggled, then kissed. The same kiss as before, but so different.

\n\nThey dressed quickly, now fully aware of just how crazy their little adventure had been, thankful that no one had indeed ventured out to the veranda to catch them. They walked arm in arm back to their hotel room… two strangers, two lovers, two companions.

\n\nVacation sex is about the moment… the wanting, the desire, and the immediate gratification. Rachel and Jared dipped their toes into the fantasy they had both wanted to experience… sex with a complete stranger. It had been everything they’d hoped for. Hot, animalistic, and a newfound desire that only served to stoke their already hot fire for each other.

\n\nStill, Rachel couldn’t help but feel a little tingle as she slipped on her pair of high heels and applied her lipstick later that evening before they headed out, wondering if Jared might wish to partake in their little game once again. Romeo was a good catch… it would be a shame to let the rest of their vacation go to waste.

        <item>

\n\nHe needed a fix, and his new favorite drug was ready and willing to assist.
She walked up to him, her hips moving like a feline on the prowl.
Her cleavage begging him to rip her dress off. Her curves elevating his temperature to dangerous levels.
She smiled, her blue eyes sparkling as she watched his gaze trail over her.
Little was as fun as seducing her playmate.
They both took intense pleasure at making the other far too ravenous to resist a feast.
She turned from him, her black summer dress covered in skulls swaying with her.
She always found a way to let her darker colors shine through. Now for the fun.
She bent over a little further than truly necessary revealing an amazing garter belt at the top of her stripped knee highs,
leading his eyes all the way up.
That was it, she had won, he was powerless to resist another moment.

\n\nIn one fluid movement our salivating suitor had one strong arm wrapped about her waist and with the other his hand wrapped lightly around her throat.
He quickly twirled her around to face him, one hand now across the small of her back,
and keeping his other hand wrapped about her throat he kissed her deeply.
She sighed in pleasure, already giving herself over to his demands.
His forcefulness removed all of her inhibitions.
She wouldn\'t trust anyone else to be so deliciously rough with her.
Giving in gave her a high that could last for days.
He slid his fingers across her throat and into her hair,
grasping a good hand full at the base of her skull,
he pulled her back with just enough strength to make her gasp with the shock of sensation.
Using his tactful grip he maneuvered her with ease, his tongue leaving no question about what was going to happen to her.
Her hands dug into his back as she struggled to remain standing.

\n\nHe loved making her moan.
It was such deep satisfaction to feel the power he had over her, to feel how hard her blood pumped when his hand gripped her throat.
He lived to make her gasp.
Her mind was blank as she moved with his desires.
He moved both hands about her waist now, moving her up against the wall.
He took both her hands in his and pinned them above her head and he continued to kiss her with a fervor rivaling the gods.
If she still had the wherewithal to think properly she would have thought\"never again will i accept anything less than this perfection\"
alas all she could do was moan and return his kisses with the thirst of a desert traveler.
Now using one hand to keep hers pinned; not that she resisted, he slid the other up her right thigh as the garter led him to do.
His talented fingers began to glide between her legs.
Much to his delight he discovered there were no panties to remove and his fingers found the source of the wetness sliding
down her shapely alabaster legs.
\"Enjoying yourself are we?\", he teased as he circled her clit and she moaned and shook,
unable to formulate a response.
\"Good answer.\" he said as he slipped a finger inside and massaged her g-spot.
She shuddered sliding slightly down the wall, trying so hard to follow the rules and remain where he wanted her.
He kissed her and continued her inside massage for a minute or two.

\n\nNow it was time for the next scene.
He let her hands go and said \"You think you can tease me and go unpunished...no no...bend over the bed...\" She happily obeyed.
As soon as her hands hit the mattress, he had the skirt of her dress up and resting comfortably on her back. Her round
ass tantalizingly exposed, the garter perfectly accentuating her lustrous curves He gave her the first spank.
Sharp but strong, mostly using the palm of his hand for force, this caused a deep reverberation inside rather than a sting outside.
She cried out again and again.
As each spank landed she tightened inside, and more and more her hunger for him grew.

\n\nHe had been hard for some time but he had every intention of making her wait.
He liked to make her wait.
\"On the bed, get on your hands and knees\" he instructed.
Again she did as she was told with not a moment\'s hesitation.
He slid his body underneath her and pulled her soaking wet pussy down to meet his tenacious tongue.
He allowed the skirt of her dress to fall about him, like a blanket fort, except decidedly more fun.
He began to devour her, lashing her from clit to cunt.
Her moans were anything but muffled.
Soon enough he reached up and put his dexterous fingers deep inside her tight, wet, pussy.
Her back arched with the added intensity his fated fingers brought.
On and on he licked, sucked, swirled, and flicked his tongue upon her helpless clit; his fingers tempting her to insanity.
He could make her cum quickly, but where\'s the fun in that? He knew precisely how to build her orgasm into a veritable explosion.
He continued his volley of licks, his fingers nearly stopping her breath as his other hand clamped onto an outer thigh,
insuring she was locked to his handsome face.
Sensing she could take no more he quickened his pace, licking her softly but at hyper speed.
In seconds spasm after spasm rocked her body with overwhelming rapture.
She cried out again and again, reaching new pitches.
The highest ones were the hardest to achieve, but he never had any trouble getting them out of her.
He held her down until she begged for him to cease fire.

\n\nHe slid out from under her and lay down beside her, delighting in watching the aftershocks continue to affect her,
as her moans got softer and her twitching less severe. \"May I please you now Master? Anything you wish.
Please allow me to return your kindness!"\ she exclaimed.

\n\n\"You know what I like, surprise me kitten.\" he replied.
She bit his neck and lightly gnawed on his ear.
She kissed him intensely and allowed her soft sweet hands to wander.
As his neck was becoming impossibly sensitive she kissed her way down his chest,
biting his rib cage and moving on to nibble at his outer and inner thighs.
His moans grew louder as he began to exclaim \"ohhh yes baby"\. She smiled, the temptress within overtaking her.
He cried out as she slipped her mouth down over his throbbing, hot, hard cock.
Now it was his thoughts that had left the building.
One hand massaged his balls as the other stroked, her mouth worked on the rest.
No man could resist her technique. She ran her tongue over the oh so sensitive tip.
She swirled her tongue as she used the exact amount of suction to drive him insane.
He moaned and moaned. Every moan she got out of him was a trophy, only driving her onward.

\n\nSummoning every bit of self-restraint he had, he bade her to stop.
\"Come up here my pet.\" he beckoned.

\n\n\"Oh yes master. Anything for you.\" she cooed.
In only the time it took her to move from in between his legs to a standing position beside the bed,
he had gotten a condom on and was ready to be ridden.

\n\n\"Come, ride your stallion.\" he urged. \"Yes, Master.\" was all she said as she slid down the straps of her dress revealing her
breasts in all their pale glory.
She knew she was to leave the rest of the dress intact and so she did as she mounted her powerful steed.
Expertly sliding him into her, they both gasped with ecstasy as her close kept cavern corrupted him.
Both her hands upon his chest, both his hands upon her breasts, she rocked back and forth, still managing to swivel her hips.
His grip tightened upon her voluptuous tits, as her continued movements drove his pleasure higher and higher.
She moved down to kiss him, her tongue embracing his as she continued to move him inside of her.

\n\nMuch to her surprise and delight, he moved her up just enough to take a nipple into his mouth. One had gripping her breast,
the other holding onto her hip for dear life as he took over and rose up to meet her insides again and again.
\"Yes, yes YES, ohhhhhhhhh god yes!\" she moaned as he fucked and fucked her.
Now gripping both of her sides tightly while her hands fell back to his chest,
he pounded her insides without reserve.
\"I\'m going to cum...inside of you...ahhhhh\" he said as he neared orgasm.

\n\n\",Yes, oh yes! Please master! Please cum in me!\" That was all he needed to hear.
He came like a cannon, firing into her again and again. She moaned with him, allowing him to continue to his desire.

\n\nFinished at last he removed himself from her warmth and cleaned himself off.
Returning to his seductress, he lay beside her and wrapped her up in his arms once more.
They kissed for a good while, trailing fingers slowly and softly over each other, enjoying the soft sensations.
As was their custom, a shower followed.
He stood beneath the waterfall as she wrapped her arms about his neck and kissed him with nothing but adoration and gratitude.
She grabbed his favorite body wash and spent ample time massaging his body clean.
She ran her hands everywhere, and he allowed every delicious touch.
Soon it was her turn, he took the soap and drizzled it playfully over her body,
enjoying the sight of it falling slowly down her many curves, as his hands soon followed after.
Once they were clean and the water would no longer stay warm, they exited, dried off and lay down.
He sat behind her, letting her rest in between his legs, her back upon his chest as he held her softly and they listened to music,
while praising each other for all of their many talents.
She leaned back her head, eyes closed, smile upon her face, lost to the world. His head leaned forward resting on hers,
smile spread wide across his face, no ill thoughts to invade.
He whispered to her \"Cheers to another adventure in Wonderland\"

\n\nI felt overwhelmed by it all to be honest. The constant attempts to dodge people in public, waiting in lines outside supermarkets and the ever so apparent feeling of paranoia. It was tiring! I was totally over wearing a mask and I was sick of the smell of hand sanitiser—a smell I had previously loved because of its ‘clean’ odour. Not now though. Lockdown was beginning to take its toll. There was not much joy found in stepping outside of the house any more so when I returned home from my weekly shopping run, Max could feel my tension instantly. He told me to let him take care of the shopping whilst I went and showered off.

\n\nShowering each time I left home and returned was normal now. I didn’t mind though. I loved the way the water beat down, it felt therapeutic. The steam engulfed me and the warm droplets caressed my flesh. I immediately felt the stresses of the last two hours, drain away. My shoulders dropped and I began to relax. I let the water run over me for at least ten minutes before washing myself and rinsing off. As I wrapped myself in the fluffiness of a fresh bath towel, the smell of fabric softener teased at my nostrils. I was a sucker for a good fragrance. After drying off, I massaged coconut oil into my skin. It was so good. I was all moisturised and glistening.

\n\nI sat at the edge of the bed and began drying my hair, as I was brushing it through, I heard Max’s voice.

\n\n“Are you OK up there babe?”

\n\n“Yep, I’m fine. I’ll be down shortly,” I replied.

\n\nI went back to brushing when Max shouted up again.

\n\n“Can I borrow you for a minute please?” he asked.

\n\nI got up, adjusted the towel and wondered what the issue was.

\n\n“Coming,” I announced as I headed downstairs.

\n\n“I’m in the study.”

\n\nHmm weird, I thought. In my head I questioned what he could be doing in the study. It soon became clear. Very clear! As I opened the door, there he was, naked in all his glory sat on one of the chairs beaming from ear to ear, waiting for some romantic sex.

\n\n“Babe, drop the towel and come over.”

\n\nI couldn’t hide the grin that crept across my face. It exposed both my surprise and excitement.

\n\nI let my towel fall to the floor, his eyes widened enthusiastically as I strutted over and stood before him. He pulled me in. I sat sideways across his lap with my legs draped over his. I could feel the semi stiffness of his cock rising against my arse. Skin to skin, I loved it. Our nakedness was sexy.

\n\nI caressed him and he caressed me. Our hands roamed over each other’s bodies whilst our lips locked and our tongues danced. Our kiss was passionate and deep, sensual and urgent. His firm grip sent shivers through me, and I squeezed my legs together desperate for some pussy licking.

\n\nHe groped me with purpose and nibbled my neck with intention. When his mouth found one of my erect nipples, I sighed deeply. The wetness of his tongue making its way down my neckline together with the gentle licking and sucking of one of my breasts, drove me wild. He listened to my sighs and tuned into the urgency of my breathing as his hand made its way towards my pussy. Two of his fingers found my clit and sandwiched it in between them. He moved them up and down rubbing and massaging. I could feel my clit swell. It grew more sensitive with every stroke.

\n\n“I love that.” I sighed gently.

\n\nAs I became more turned on, I couldn’t resist touching myself too. We rubbed my pussy together, then Max told me to stand up. I did as I was told and leaned against the wall. Max jumped up off the chair and slipped down in front of me. He sat on the floor and positioned himself beneath me. He used one of his hands to pull me closer as his other hand ran up and down my leg.

\n\nHis mouth connected with my cunt and his tongue darted in between my pussy lips with a firm flicking motion. It wasn’t long before he introduced his own lips into the equation. His mouth massaged me. I pushed my hips forward, urging him to taste me deeper. He licked me up and down, sucked at my clit and tongued me into ecstasy. I grinded on his face. He loved it!

\n\nThis was pleasure.

\n\nAs he pulled me closer still, I took both of my hands and parted my pussy lips to expose my hardened clit to the elements. He now had uninterrupted access. He took full advantage of that. Involuntary moans escaped my lips and deep throated pants filled the room.

\n\n“Suck my clit harder,” I begged.

\n\nHe did. I moaned even more as I used my hand to control his head. I pulled him in, pushed him away, pulled him forward and then pushed him back again, all whilst panting deeply.

\n\nI was so wet. Wet from Max’s oral onslaught and soaking in my own pussy juices.

\n\nMax lapped it all up causing my legs to weaken as the blissful sensations cruised through my snatch spreading throughout my whole body.

\n\nThe intensity of the feeling forced me to drop down on to his face. His hands supported me. I had lost control.

\n\nMy legs rested on Max’s shoulders and as he continued to pleasure me with his mouth, I sunk deeper and deeper into a thrilling stupor.

\n\nEventually, I let my legs slide down from his shoulders and wound up straddled across him, face to face.

\n\n“Kiss me,” Max ordered.

\n\nHe wanted me to taste my own juices. I was happy to oblige. I tasted sweet and I smelled so good. No wonder he couldn’t get enough.

\n\nWe kissed deeply as Max cradled me between his legs and torso. I could feel his fully erect cock bobbing about at the base of my back. The thought of it and how it looked in all its rigid magnificence, conjured a desperate need to feel his erection in both my hands and in my mouth. I wanted to taste him so badly.

\n\n“Sit on the chair babe,” I said as sexily as possible.

\n\nHe hopped up and sat upright, legs apart, cock standing fully to attention. I just loved the sight of him. That cock was mine!

\n\nI gently jerked him off and then lowered my mouth down on to him feeling the zing of precum on my tongue. He tasted sweet so I swallowed that then proceeded to wrap my mouth around his girth and suck him off. My motion was measured at first. Slow, deep strokes. I took him in as far as my tonsils would allow. I could taste his sweetness drip to the back of my throat as I took him deep. He groaned with delight as I bobbed up and down. I moved away from his cock and kissed him. I wanted him to experience how amazing he tasted too.

\n\nI brought my mouth back down to his hot and throbbing dick but it wasn’t long before the urge to feel him deep inside me took over. I wanted him to pulsate as he entered me, I wanted my cervix to contract as he filled me up entirely taking my mind even further away from the restriction of lockdown and the rules which governed our day to day.

\n\nHere there were no rules. Well, none but one. Pleasure was the only rule here. In this room, away from the fear of the pandemic, safe in the knowledge that this moment was ours without fear and without worry, I lowered myself down onto him…gently.

\n\n“Oh yes,” he murmured.

\n\nI sighed as I took him all in.

\n\nPangs of sensuality engulfed me. Ripples of delight flowed through me and as I slid up and down his rock hard member I transcended to a higher level of ecstasy. This was bliss!

\n\nBoth his hands cupped my arse cheeks and guided me further and deeper into my feels.

\n\nThere was no holding back. Unmistakeable cries of pleasure and passion-filled the room.

\n\nI moved in even closer, pressing my waist more firmly against him. I wanted him as close as possible, no space between us. He bucked his chest forward. I needed that. We are in trying times and this made me feel safe, wanted and desired. Everything connected, mind body and soul.

\n\nI wanted to move it up a notch. The slow grinding was nice but I wanted frenzied.

\n\nStill on top, I quickened my pace—my legs maintaining a rhythm as I bounced up and down on his cock with precision.

\n\nI loved the sensation of his cock being brought to the entrance of my pussy only to slam back down on it. He felt so fucking deep inside, it sent decadent waves through me every time.

\n\nMax remained focused on me staring intensely as I rode his cock like a badass cowgirl. His face looked flushed. It always did when he was super turned on.

\n\n“You’re so naughty,” he told me

\n\n“Only for you,” I panted in between strokes.

\n\nHe licked his lips and tilted his head back slightly giving himself the perfect view of his cock going in and out of my pussy as I continued to have my way with him.

\n\nHis moans and my groans made music. We were totally in sync.

\n\nAlthough it felt almost impossible, I wanted him even deeper. I flung my head back and he held on to my wrists. My back arched and his cock flipped up inside me, hitting my cervix from a more intense angle. Fuzzy feels and wetness took over. My mind was hazy. I wanted to cum but I wasn’t ready to…yet.

\n\nI moved back up and he embraced me, pulling me in tight whilst his cock repositioned itself inside me once again. He grabbed at my arse and moved with me as I gyrated all over him. I could feel my wetness in his lap. I was gushing!

\n\nMax wanted to take me from the back. He was generally quite a passive guy, charming and unassuming but when it came to sex, he knew what he wanted and whilst for the most part, his whole bit was about satisfying me, he also knew what it was that he desired. He knew what he liked and he knew what got him off. Fucking me from the back was just one of those things he loved.

\n\n“I need to fuck you from behind,” he said under his breath

\n\nHe didn’t have to ask me twice. I unsaddled him and he stood up. We swapped places. It was my turn to use the chair as a prop. I hopped on, knees first. I held on to the back of the chair for support, opened my legs just enough and cocked my arse into the air. I wanted him to see all of me from this angle. I wanted his cock to flex at the sight of my exposed, dripping wet pussy just waiting for him to enter.

\n\nAs he slid in, my knees trembled. I knew it would be difficult for me to contain myself. I felt dominated and submissive. I was his and wanted him to do whatever he needed to. I was totally at his mercy.

\n\nThe stroke of his thick cock forced me to tilt my arse even further. I let him go deep. He went deeper. He found his stride and proceeded to fuck the shit out of me.

\n\nHe was hungry. His balls slapped against me. That only added to the pleasure. It was such a sexy situation, that I felt compelled to let one of my hands drop down to my pussy again and find my lovebud.

\n\nAs he fucked me, I rubbed my nub. The combination of penetration and clit stimulation drove me mad. Me playing with my pussy turned him on even more too. His unquenchable desire forced him to take his hands off my arse and wrap his arms around me and grapple at my body. He clumsily grabbed at my breasts and waist as the passion warped his coordination temporarily. Soon enough, his speedy thrusts slowed to a more meaningful plunge like motion. I loved the variation. Max knew how to diversify the intercourse. The switching up definitely pleased me.

\n\nHis cock ran so deep. His stroke forced me to arch my back in order to accommodate him. I felt every sensation, every slip, every dip, every thrust, every pulse. My pussy was super sensitive and in response to all the excitement, my juices flowed lavishly. The squelching sound my pussy made each time he pumped, was a massive turn on too.

\n\nMax held on to both of my arse cheeks and spread them slightly. This allowed him to really get in and hit my spot. The spot that took me to seventh heaven. The spot that guaranteed a breakdown in my senses, a loss of vision through the haze and an out of body experience that left me completely at his mercy.

\n\nHis firm grasp added another level of intensity. I wailed with passion. I couldn’t hold anything in. I sighed and squealed, whimpered and breathed deeply. My sounds made him pick up the pace again. His pumping was now in time with my accelerated heart rate. I rose to the brink, I was there, about to tip when he switched it up again.

\n\nIn one fell swoop, Max guided me off the chair and backed himself up against the wall. He pulled me towards him, back first and entered me as I stood in front. As he penetrated me, I shivered. This position literally picked up from the last but the penetration was shallower. I loved it though. It gave me time to slow my breathing down.

\n\nI leant forward as he held both my arms back. This allowed his cock to come further out of my pussy and slam back in…something I absolutely adored.

\n\nOur bodies made shapes. Vitruvian-esque shapes. Shapes a renaissance artist would have absolutely gotten excited about. This was geometry. Sexy, fucking geometry!

\n\nWe continued to bask in ecstasy as one of his hands ran up and down my body, stopping only to confidently grab at my breasts and then to make its way back down to my pussy.

\n\nHe rubbed my clit as he continued to tantalise me with his shaft. I bit my lip and leaned back into him

\n\n“Baby, let me cum please,” I begged

\n\nHe giggled and continued to rub my throbbing clit and fuck my saturated pussy. I was intoxicated as the aching feeling of my inevitable orgasm worked its way up from the soles of my feet, up into my thighs until eventually, it consumed every inch of my body.

\n\nI buzzed inside and my knees buckled. My ankles gave way and my body lost all its tension. Max’s thrusts alone were what kept me upright. If it wasn’t for the urgency of his probing, I would have most certainly been a heap on the floor.

\n\nI was giving in to the feeling. I couldn’t fight it. My cervix pulsated and my pussy spurted fluid.

\n\n “Cum for me,” Max whispered in my ear.

\n\n That hurled me right over the edge. The deepness of his voice forced the tiny hairs in my ears to stand to attention. My head was giddy, my breasts tingled, my legs began to shake and I exploded. I literally erupted all over his cock. Gloopy and in abundance. The rush was colossal, it finished me.

\n\nIn that very moment, as I sunk deeper into ecstasy, Max took three more long and purposeful thrusts before I felt the force of his ejaculation enter me. His body folded on to me but he managed to somehow prevent himself from collapsing completely. He grabbed at my pussy as he convulsed from his own pleasure.

\n\nWe transcended to another planet. Planet bliss!

\n\nWe were completely at the mercy of this joy.

\n\nAs my body continued to buzz, Max linked his fingers with mine and embraced me as we closed our eyes and enjoyed the outcome of a truly stimulating and absolutely necessary sensual session.

\n\nAs we caught our breath, Max turned to me and said: “Now tell me, how do you really feel?”

\n\nInitially, I couldn’t muster the energy to tell him there and then but knew in my head that, provided this was what I was going to be getting whilst outside remained to be a weird, panicky place, I knew I’d be OK.

\n\nYes the lockdown was a bitch but this was a reminder of the importance and power of intimacy. Max made me feel good. He made me feel sexy and most importantly, he made me lose myself and forget my stresses, worries and concerns.

\n\n“I feel great,” I said.

\n\nIt took a lot of effort to speak, but he needed to know. I wanted him to feel my appreciation. I was thankful. Thankful for him and thankful for amazing sex.

\n\nAs my pussy continued to tingle and my cervix continued to contract, I didn’t care for the restrictions of the pandemic, in fact a potentially killer virus and the threat it posed, couldn’t have been further from my mind.
